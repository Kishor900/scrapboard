Once you have grasped some of the basics, one of the best ways to learn is to start building a small project.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking to explore adding JavaScript to WordPress theming, check out <a href="https://github.com/ryelle/Anadama-React" target="_blank">Anadama</a>, an experimental <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React</a>-based theme that uses the <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/" target="_blank">WP REST API</a> to deliver content.</p>\n<p>Anadama was designed to display recipe content in a vintage recipe book style. This niche theme is well-suited to presentation as a single-page app, since it has no comments or widgets. The homepage features a menu and post titles that pop up as recipe cards.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/single-recipe.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49512"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/single-recipe.png?resize=1025%2C1279" alt="single-recipe" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49512" /></a></p>\n<p>Anadama is a project still in progress, created through the collaborative efforts of developer <a href="http://t.co/vG6mrybZs8" target="_blank">Kelly Dwan</a> and designer <a href="https://twitter.com/melchoyce" target="_blank">Mel Choyce</a>, authors of popular themes <a href="http://wptavern.com/flounder-a-free-wordpress-theme-with-colorful-post-formats" target="_blank">Flounder</a> and <a href="http://wptavern.com/aventurine-a-free-wordpress-theme-featuring-bold-typography-and-bright-colors" target="_blank">Aventurine</a>.</p>\n<p>The theme is small project where you can see an example of how React might fit into a WordPress theme. It requires the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/" target="_blank">REST API plugin</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-api-menus/" target="_blank">WP API Menus</a>. If you want to take it for a spin and experiment for yourself, clone the theme&#8217;s <a href="https://github.com/ryelle/Anadama-React" target="_blank">GitHub repo</a> to your test install and then run npm and gulp to install and build the JavaScript and CSS files. If you prefer a more traditional blog example, Dwan recommends checking out her <a href="https://github.com/ryelle/Foxhound" target="_blank">Foxhound</a> theme on GitHub.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Thu, 10 Dec 2015 20:34:32 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:1;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:68:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 216 – WordCamp US 2015 Recap Roundtable";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=49524&preview_id=49524";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-216-wordcamp-us-2015-recap-roundtable";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2566:"<p>In this episode of WordPress Weekly, <a href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I are joined by <a href="http://cantspeakgeek.com/">Michele Butcher</a>, <a href="http://cantspeakgeek.com/">Nik Vimil</a>, <a href="http://kikodoran.com/">Kiko Doran</a>, and <a href="https://www.chriswiegman.com/">Chris Wiegman</a> as we recap the first annual WordCamp US.

According to organizer <a href="https://twitter.com/petyeah" target="_blank">Petya Raykovska</a>, they are expecting 1700 attendees this year in Vienna, Austria.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We opened ticket sales more than seven months before the event and it&#8217;s going a lot better than expected,&#8221; she said. &#8220;Initially we prepared for 1200 attendees but the first 1,000 tickets were sold out in less than three weeks and luckily our venue capacity is much bigger this year so we will probably be able to do 1700.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In addition to gathering volunteers and getting sponsors for WCEU 2016, organizers are also doing a mentoring program for five different cities interested in hosting the next event. The call for applicants for 2017 will be open in two weeks.</p>\n<h3>What to Expect at WCEU 2016: An Emphasis on Networking</h3>\n<p>I caught up with Raykovska at WordCamp US and asked her if attendees can expect to have a European WordPress community summit attached to the event.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are ready to organize a community summit in Europe before or after the WordCamp, but this is not our decision,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;It has to be pre-approved by the Foundation and there is a team that has handled the summit so far. We are more than ready to host one if we are allowed.</p>\n<p>&#8220;WordCamp Europe will be in June, which is less than six months from the most recent community summit, so it might not be a perfect fit in terms of time frame but we are definitely ready to jump in and help organize a community summit in Europe when we get permission,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>Raykovska said that each year&#8217;s event is designed to be a unique experience for attendees, because WordCamps are so much more than simply attending sessions.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We are switching locations on purpose, not just to provide a chance for a new local community to host it each year but to make it more interesting for attendees, to make it a cultural experience,&#8221; she said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;Last year we did networking and speed networking &#8211; we put some effort into making sure people actually got to know each other and not just attend the conference to listen to talks. This year we are going to expand on that and organize some small warm-up events before the conference.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The idea is to help people make a connection,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;We&#8217;re going to try to extend last year&#8217;s networking efforts and make sure that attendees meet as many other people as possible and not just stay in their small groups,&#8221; she said, emphasizing the importance of this aspect, as European communities are all different.</p>\n<h3>A Family Friendly Event</h3>\n<p>As the event is held during summer in the northern hemisphere, WordCamp Europe organizers recognize that many attendees may be traveling with their families.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to try to make the event a lot more family friendly,&#8221; Raykovska said. &#8220;We know that as the community grows, the people grow with it. There have been so many wonderful WordPress babies in the past year and we&#8217;ve noticed all of them. We want to make sure that when people travel they can bring their families along and it can be a good family experience as well.&#8221;</p>\n<p>A children&#8217;s museum is located right next door to the WordCamp venue with activities for all ages.</p>\n<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re trying to establish a connection with them and working to make sure that our space provides for families and people who want to bring their kids over and spend some quality time and also go listen to sessions,&#8221; she said. Childcare is a possibility they are considering.</p>\n<p>Only 228 <a href="https://europe.wordcamp.org/2016/tickets/" target="_blank">tickets</a> remain at this time and Raykovska said they&#8217;re disappearing fast. The demand for tickets is a testament to the quality of this event and its organizers. If you&#8217;re planning to attend WordCamp Europe 2016, don&#8217;t put off buying your ticket.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 09 Dec 2015 21:38:47 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:7;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"Post Status: Interview with Scott Taylor, WordPress 4.4 release lead — Draft Podcast";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=15182";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"https://poststatus.com/interview-with-scott-taylor-wordpress-4-4-release-lead-draft-podcast/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2049:"<p>Welcome to the Post Status <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Draft podcast</a>, which you can find <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/post-status-draft-wordpress/id976403008">on iTunes</a>, <a href="http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/krogsgard/post-status-draft-wordpress-podcast">Stitcher</a>, and <a href="http://simplecast.fm/podcasts/1061/rss">via RSS</a> for your favorite podcatcher.

Check out <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clifford_Brown">his Wikipedia</a> for more information about him.</p>\n<p>You can view all <a href="https://trac.wordpress.org/query?status=closed&milestone=4.4">closed tickets for WordPress 4.4</a>, and view an evolving overview of changes on the <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Version_4.4">4.4 Codex page</a> as well.</p>\n<p>Here’s a video overview of WordPress 4.4:</p>\n<p><br />\n</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.4 includes a variety of user facing and developer features, and I consider it to be one of the most important releases for developers, and the way WordPress can be extended, in years.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s go over some of the most notable features in 4.4:</p>\n<h3>WordPress REST API infrastructure</h3>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15184" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/banner-1544x500-752x244.png" alt="banner-1544x500" width="752" height="244" /></p>\n<p>The <a href="http://v2.wp-api.org/">WordPress REST API</a> is going into WordPress core in multiple parts, starting with the infrastructure in 4.4. The endpoints will go in, &#8220;in a future release,&#8221; likely starting with endpoints for some core object types in 4.5, but full coverage may span multiple releases.</p>\n<p>The REST API has been widely covered, and was a focus area of the WordCamp US conference, but it is also a rapidly evolving part of WordPress. Decisions going into the REST API now will affect WordPress as a whole for many years.</p>\n<p>There are many reasons the API is going in infrastructure first, but one important reason is that the code going into core for 4.4 is quite isolated from the endpoints that are not going in yet. The infrastructure provides a lot of helpers for plugins to extend for supporting custom endpoints, while giving the REST API and core team more time to evolve the endpoints and work out a variety of remaining challenges.</p>\n<p>For people using the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/">WordPress REST API feature plugin</a> (version 2 or later), you&#8217;ll still want to have the plugin installed after updating to 4.4, as the plugin will continue to provide the endpoints that are already developed.</p>\n<p>The REST API infrastructure going into core is also a statement of core team endorsement, which the API needed after years of development, so that developers would be comfortable basing large projects on it, with the understanding that it would be supported for a long time.</p>\n<p>Amongst the challenges that remain for the REST API project is creating parity with the WordPress.com REST API. The WordPress.com REST API has been separately developed from the core REST API, but a number of important applications use the WordPress.com version, and both the core REST API team and key members at WordPress.com parent company Automattic believe it is in the best interest of both APIs for them to be interchangeable.</p>\n<p>Both APIs have made decisions that would require some sort of bridge or support-breaking versioning in order to get on the same page. Automattic has made resources available to work with the core team over coming months to help ensure that the two play nicely together.</p>\n<p>The REST API infrastructure hitting core is a huge milestone that will take WordPress to the next level. It&#8217;s more possible than ever for WordPress to be used as an application platform. It also means we will see more examples of websites using parts of WordPress and decoupling from other parts.</p>\n<p>The REST API is the work of dozens, but an enormous amount of credit is due to four people that have pushed this cart up the big hill of core inclusion: Ryan McCue and Rachel Baker have lead the project, and Joe Hoyle and Daniel Bachhuber have been hugely influential in code and architectural decisions.</p>\n<p>Interested in learning more about the WordPress REST API? Here are some links to help:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/wp-api">WordPress REST API website and documentation</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/rest-api/">Official WordPress REST API plugin</a> (still important for users needing endpoints)</li>\n<li><a href="https://github.com/wp-api">WordPress REST API Github</a> (includes helper clients and libraries, plus all versions of code)</li>\n<li><a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-json-rest-api/">Introduction to the REST API</a> (basics, pre v2 information)</li>\n<li><a href="https://poststatus.com/the-wordpress-rest-api-draft-podcast/">All about the REST API</a> (recent, deep dive podcast)</li>\n<li><a href="https://poststatus.com/a-future-api/">A Future API</a> (theoretical future world where the REST API is in use)</li>\n<li><a href="https://poststatus.com/state-of-the-word-2015/">State of the Word, 2015</a> (REST API played a starring role)</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Congratulations to everyone involved on making this important step to WordPress&#8217;s future.</p>\n<h3>Responsive Images</h3>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15185" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/resp-images-752x312.gif" alt="resp-images" width="752" height="312" /></p>\n<p>Another hugely important feature for WordPress 4.4 is the inclusion of the <a href="https://responsiveimages.org/">Responsive Images Community Group&#8217;s</a> feature <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/ricg-responsive-images/">plugin</a>, which is based on a specification now broadly supported in modern browsers.</p>\n<p>Project lead Joe McGill outlined <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/11/10/responsive-images-in-wordpress-4-4/">how responsive images work</a>, from a technical perspective, in a recent Make Core post. Essentially, WordPress now has support for dynamically replacing images for small viewports and for retina screens. The functionality operates on an underlying WordPress function that enables responsive images on new posts and old, both in the content and within most functions themes use to display images.</p>\n<p>You may wonder what images will be made available. At its core, the plugin puts all images that are the same aspect ratio as the requested image in the <code>srcset</code>. So if you insert a full size image and it is 1500×1500 and your large image size is 1024×1024 (the WordPress default), it would replace the full size with the large size for smaller viewports, because it is both smaller and it is the same aspect ratio.</p>\n<p>If an image isn’t the same aspect ratio, it wouldn’t be used; so it prevents, for example, an intended landscape image from being replaced by a vertically cropped image on a smaller screen. Because WordPress default images skip from 300px to 1024px, a new image size has been introduced to increase the likelihood one is available for use in the <code>srcset</code>. Any custom image sizes will be available as well.</p>\n<p>With this functionality, most images on every WordPress website in the world will be responsive-ready as soon as the sites are updated to WordPress 4.4. It&#8217;s a massive win for WordPress, as well as the broader web community.</p>\n<h3>Term meta and taxonomy improvements</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.4 includes a long requested feature for terms with the introduction of term meta support. Term meta works much like post meta, and makes several new functions available: <code>add_term_meta()</code>, <code>update_term_meta()</code>, <code>delete_term_meta()</code>, and <code>get_term_meta()</code>.</p>\n<p>Folks have used custom term meta for ages, but with core support, there&#8217;s now a standard way to enable developers to store arbitrary data to terms. Just like post meta, term meta can be abused, but when used smartly, it will increase the possibilities for complex websites that have complex post and term relationships. I also anticipate we&#8217;ll see helpers and user interfaces show up that make the process for registering meta fields and various form field types a simple process.</p>\n<p>In addition to term meta, 4.4 also introduces <code>WP_Term</code>. Developers won&#8217;t notice a big difference now, but as project lead Boone Gorges put it <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/23/4-4-taxonomy-roundup/">in the overview post</a>, &#8220;in the future, <code>WP_Term</code> will allow for more extensive caching throughout the Taxonomy component, as well as the potential for method chaining and other developer conveniences.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>oEmbed for WordPress posts</h3>\n<p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-15189" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/wpoembed.png" alt="wpoembed" width="613" height="249" /></a></p>\n<p>WordPress posts can now be embedded anywhere, with the new core <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/">WordPress supported oEmbed feature</a>. Lead by new committer Pascal Birchler as a feature as plugin, oEmbed makes sharing a WordPress post as easy as putting the URL on its own line, just as if you were sharing a Tweet or other oEmbed provider piece of content.</p>\n<h3>Twenty Sixteen</h3>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-large wp-image-15190" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/twentysixteen-752x564.png" alt="twentysixteen" width="752" height="564" /></p>\n<p>Twenty Sixteen marks the seventh Twenty-series default WordPress theme. Twenty Sixteen is another minimalist WordPress theme with a focus on blogging. Its two most visible features are the negative margin large images in the content, and the support for nearly any color background.</p>\n<p>I think Twenty Sixteen is nice, but it isn&#8217;t groundbreaking theme territory. That may well change with Twenty Seventeen, which I imagine will have a larger JavaScript influence, but Twenty Sixteen is still a nice iteration on the WordPress default theme.</p>\n<p>Designed by Takashi Irie, you can find more about Twenty Sixteen on a Make Core <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/23/under-the-hood-of-twenty-sixteen/">internals post</a>, its official <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/">WordPress.org theme page</a>, <a href="https://twentysixteendemo.wordpress.com/">view the demo</a>, or see the <a href="https://github.com/WordPress/twentysixteen">development history</a> on Github.</p>\n<h3><code>WP_Comment</code> and comments overhaul</h3>\n<p>Comments were a bit of a mess in WordPress. Release lead Scott Taylor took this component under his wing for 4.4, and along with Rachel Baker (the component lead), revamped a lot of comment internals.</p>\n<p>Scott talked more about digging into WordPress comments in this week&#8217;s <a href="https://poststatus.com/category/draft">Post Status Draft podcast</a> (posting soon).</p>\n<h3>More Multisite goodies</h3>\n<p>Just as I&#8217;ve said in 4.3, and previous releases, it makes me happy to repeat that Multisite continues to see active development.</p>\n<p>As <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-4/">Jeremy Felt outlines</a>, WordPress 4.4 includes new support for <code>WP_Network</code> (that makes three new objects in 4.4 for those keeping count at home) as well as new network functions, actions, and filters.</p>\n<h3>Another great WordPress release</h3>\n<p>WordPress 4.4 is an outstanding release, and Release Lead Scott Taylor deserves a ton of credit for steering the ship. This release saw more overall commit activity than WordPress has seen in a single release in years.</p>\n<p>In addition to a lot of code improvements, many community members made incredible efforts to consistently garden <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/">Trac</a>, where WordPress core development happens, and ensure that all tickets received at least some level of attention during the release phase of 4.4.</p>\n<p>Congratulations to everyone that received props, wrote docs, advocated for, or otherwise contributed to WordPress 4.4. It&#8217;s a great way to end the year for WordPress, and sets a path for a very exciting 2016 for the WordPress project.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 09 Dec 2015 00:18:52 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:10;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"WPTavern: WordPress 4.4 “Clifford” Featuring Responsive Images, Twenty Sixteen, and More";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=49346";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:94:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-4-clifford-featuring-responsive-images-twenty-sixteen-and-more";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9908:"<p>After four months of intense development led by <a href="http://scotty-t.com/">Scott Taylor</a>, WordPress 4.4 &#8220;Clifford&#8221; named after jazz trumpeter <a href="http://cliffordbrown.net/">Clifford Brown</a>, is <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2015/12/clifford/">available for download</a>. This release features responsive images, WordPress embeds, the Twenty Sixteen default theme, the first half of the REST API, and a host of small improvements.</p>\n<p></p>\n<h2>Responsive Images</h2>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ResponsiveImagesFeature.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49355"><img class="size-full wp-image-49355" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/ResponsiveImagesFeature.png?resize=1025%2C470" alt="Responsive Images in WordPress 4.4" /></a>Responsive Images in WordPress 4.4\n<p>When users upload images to WordPress, it automatically crops them to smaller sizes. For example, if you upload an image that’s 1500 x 706, the image sizes might look like this:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Full Size – 1500 x 706</li>\n<li>Large – 500 x 235</li>\n<li>Medium – 300 x 141</li>\n<li>Thumbnail – 150 x 150</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress 4.4 adds <code>srcset</code> and <code>sizes</code> support to WordPress. This allows the software to automatically use and display the right image based on a device’s screen size. If I attach a full size 1500 x 706 image to a post in WordPress 4.4 to be viewed on a desktop, mobile devices will see the large or medium-sized image instead.</p>\n<p>This decreases the amount of bandwidth used to load websites since smaller images have smaller file sizes. <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/11/10/responsive-images-in-wordpress-4-4/">Responsive images</a> don’t have any settings to configure as the magic happens behind the scenes.</p>\n<h2>Embed WordPress Posts</h2>\n<p>For a number of years, users have been able to embed content from <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Embeds">trusted sources</a> simply by pasting the URL into the visual editor. In 4.4, WordPress itself becomes a trusted oEmbed source which allows anyone to easily embed content from WordPress powered sites.</p>\n<p>Embedded content displays in an iframe with a link to comments, a share icon, and an excerpt of the post. Here&#8217;s an example of what an oEmbedded post from a site running WordPress 4.4 looks like.</p>\n<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content"><p><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/30/feature-plugin-merge-proposal-oembed/">Feature Plugin Merge Proposal: oEmbed</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>If you want to disable the ability for people to embed your content, install and activate the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/disable-embeds/">Disable Embeds</a> plugin. Disable Embeds does the following:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Prevents others from embedding your site.</li>\n<li>Prevents you from embedding other non-whitelisted sites.</li>\n<li>Disables all JavaScript related to the feature.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress embeds started off as a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/new-embeds-feature-in-wordpress-4-4/">feature plugin proposal</a> by Pascal Birchler. Check out <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/32522">ticket #32522</a> to see how it progressed from a proposal to a core feature.</p>\n<h2>Phase One of the REST API</h2>\n<p>WordPress 4.4 includes the first half of the REST API. The infrastructure portion of the API handles the routing, argument handling, JSON serialisation/deserialisation, status codes, and other items related to the API.</p>\n<p>Plugin and theme authors can start using the API immediately using the infrastructure in core to replace existing custom <code>admin-ajax</code> endpoints. To learn how to authenticate with the API, see <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/rest-api-welcome-the-infrastructure-to-core/">this post</a> by Ryan Mccue.</p>\n<h2>Twenty Sixteen</h2>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/twentysixteen/">Twenty Sixteen</a> is a new default theme designed by <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/iamtakashi">Takashi Irie,</a> that was built with a mobile first, responsive approach. It has an optional right-hand sidebar and displays author information to the left of posts. It comes with four different color schemes, dark, gray, red, and yellow. Each scheme can be modified using the Customizer.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/TwentySixteenHomepage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49348"><img class="size-full wp-image-49348" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/TwentySixteenHomepage.png?resize=1025%2C769" alt="Twenty Sixteen Homepage" /></a>Twenty Sixteen Homepage\n<h2>Other Noteworthy Changes</h2>\n<h3>WordPress Multisite</h3>\n<p>WordPress Multisite has a new class called <code>WP_Network</code>. There&#8217;s also <code>*_network_option</code> functions which make it easier to use multiple networks. Jeremy Felt <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/multisite-focused-changes-in-4-4/">highlights new hooks added</a>, bug fixes, and deprecated functions.</p>\n<h3>WP_Comments Component is Rebuilt</h3>\n<p>The <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/comment-object-and-query-features-in-4-4/">comments component</a> has undergone a substantial amount of work. The most noticeable difference is that the comment field displays first, followed by the Name, Email, and URL fields. This change improves navigation when using the keyboard to toggle through fields. It also makes it easier for users to leave comments.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentsFirst.png" rel="attachment wp-att-48366"><img class="size-full wp-image-48366" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/CommentsFirst.png?resize=1024%2C992" alt="Comment Text Area is First" /></a>Comment Text Area is First\n<h3>Changes to the Headings Hierarchy on Admin Screens</h3>\n<p>In an effort to improve accessibility, the headings hierarchy in the backend of WordPress 4.4 <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/07/31/headings-in-admin-screens-change-in-wordpress-4-3/">restores the H1 heading level</a> to admin screens. This helps screen readers discern and locate important information on a page.</p>\n<p>Plugin and theme authors are highly encouraged to restructure their document headings hierarchy to ensure that heading levels are not skipped. Andrea Fercia <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/28/headings-hierarchy-changes-in-the-admin-screens/">explains why it matters</a> and how to ensure you have the proper headings.</p>\n<h3>Taxonomy Term Meta</h3>\n<p>In the last few releases cycles, the team has been working hard to complete tasks from the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/08/27/taxonomy-roadmap-for-4-4-and-beyond/">Taxonomy roadmap</a>.</p>\n<p>In WordPress 4.3, the development team successfully split shared taxonomy terms, which ensures that terms can be uniquely identified by their <code>term_id</code>. In 4.4, the <code>$taxonomy</code> parameter is now optional in <code>get_term()</code> and <code>get_term_field()</code>, functions that previously required both <code>$term_id</code> and <code>$taxonomy</code>.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.4 also introduces <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/10142">Term Meta</a> where developers can use the new term meta API to store arbitrary data about taxonomy terms, in the same way you would for posts, users, or comments.</p>\n<p>Boone Gorges, one of the lead developers working on the roadmap, <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/23/4-4-taxonomy-roundup/">explains the improvements</a> in detail related to Taxonomy data in WordPress 4.4.</p>\n<h3>WP_Title is Not Deprecated</h3>\n<p>Contrary to <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-4-4-to-deprecate-the-wp_title-function">earlier reports</a>, the core development team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/11/11/wordpress-4-4-field-guide/">decided</a> not to deprecate the WP_Title function. It&#8217;s considered a zombie function and <code>add_theme_support( </code><code>''title-tag''</code> ); remains the recommended way to insert the title tag in themes.</p>\n<h3>Miscellaneous Changes</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>my-hacks.php is not deprecated and will remain in WordPress</li>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/10/07/single-post_type-post_name-php-new-theme-template-in-wordpress-4-4/">New theme template</a> in WordPress 4.4: single-{post_type}-{post_name}.php</li>\n<li>Unattached attachments <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/changeset/34690">have pretty permalinks</a></li>\n<li>The <code>show_ui</code> argument for post types <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2015/09/15/enforcing-the-show_ui-argument-for-post-types/">is now enforced</a> to correct unexpected behavior</li>\n</ul>\n<p>WordPress 4.4 has more than 2,000 commits from over 400 contributors. In the <a href="https://videopress.com/v/0taparK5">State of The Word 2015</a>, Taylor says that one of the goals in this release was to go through the extensive backlog of tickets and review patches that were forgotten. Thanks to the efforts of volunteer <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/bug-gardening/">bug gardeners</a> on <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/">Trac</a>, he <a href="https://core.trac.wordpress.org/ticketgraph">accomplished that goal</a>.</p>\n<p>If you experience any issues with WordPress 4.4, please <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/">report them on the support forums</a>. Volunteers are watching support threads closely and, if warranted, will create a thread listing known issues.

According to <a href="https://twitter.com/wpdevcasts" target="_blank">Zac Gordon</a>, one of the site&#8217;s former educators, no new WordPress, BuddyPress, or WooCommerce courses will be created and existing content will not be updated in the future.</p>\n<p>&#8220;The online learning company where I have been teaching WordPress for the last 3+ years told me that they were going to stop teaching WordPress, give my salary to a .NET teacher, and fire me,&#8221; Gordon said.</p>\n<p>In a <a href="http://wp.zacgordon.com/2015/12/08/the-sustaining-heart-of-the-wordpress-community/" target="_blank">post</a> announcing his departure, Gordon said that during his employment at Treehouse he was unable to convince the company of the value of investing in WordPress.</p>\n<p>&#8220;While working at Treehouse I attended between 8-12 WordCamps per year and spoke about a range of the subjects I taught at Treehouse,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Not everyone knows this, but Treehouse didn’t pay for 95% of these trips. In fact, I regularly fought with Treehouse to see the value of sponsoring WordCamps, sending me to them to speak, and even that giving back to the community is an important thing we should do.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Gordon&#8217;s understanding is that Treehouse will now be focusing its resources on technologies like Java, .NET, and JavaScript.</p>\n<p>Despite the struggle to find a new way to support himself, Gordon is determined to continue <a href="http://wpdevcasts.com/" target="_blank">teaching WordPress</a>. Check out WP Tavern&#8217;s exclusive interview with him at WordCamp US where he elaborates on Treehouse&#8217;s decision.</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 08 Dec 2015 20:54:56 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:12;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:74:"WPTavern: WPShout Is Accepting Submissions for Its 2016 Web Hosting Survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=49359";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"http://wptavern.com/wpshout-is-accepting-submissions-for-its-2016-webhosting-survey";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1469:"<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WPShoutWebhostingSurveyFeaturedImage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-30463"><img class="size-full wp-image-30463" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/WPShoutWebhostingSurveyFeaturedImage.png?resize=635%2C265" alt="WPShout Webhosting Survey Featured Image" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/henryfaber/230444653/">hfabulous</a> &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>It&#8217;s that time of year again where WPShout is asking WordPress users far and wide to fill out its <a href="http://wpshout.com/announcing-the-2016-wordpress-hosting-review/">web hosting survey</a>.

Roughly 1,800 WordPress enthusiasts came from all corners of the world to attend the event.</p>\n<p>Ambling down Philly&#8217;s historic streets, lined with Benjamin Franklin monuments, one cannot help but consider how far publishing has come since the days when each letter was laboriously placed to form documents with copies cranked out one at a time.</p>\n<p>Francis Bacon equated the power of the pen to that of gunpowder when he <a href="https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/Novum_Organum">identified printing</a> as one of three inventions that changed the world &#8211; &#8220;so much that no empire, no sect, no star seems to have exerted greater power and influence in human affairs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>WordPress has played a major part in making publishing available to everyone in the digital age, an important reason why the project&#8217;s influence continues to grow more than a decade later.</p>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg delivered his 10th annual State of the Word address to the largest WordCamp crowd to date. In reviewing stats from 2015 he highlighted the fact that WordPress now powers 25% of the web.</p>\n<p>&#8220;This is a not a chance to rest on our laurels,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">It&#8217;s a demonstration that the world wants a free, open source solution for the web.</span>&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg shared 2015 stats that show the community behind WordPress is growing in tandem with its global usage:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>89 WordCamps with 21,000 attendees across 34 countries</li>\n<li>601 unique organizers, 60% for the first time</li>\n<li>1.6K speakers presented 2.1K sessions</li>\n<li>40,000 people attended 2,000 meetups in the past year</li>\n</ul>\n<p>He also highlighted WordPress&#8217; major improvements and milestones:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Moved from downloads to activity-based metrics in the theme and plugin directories</li>\n<li>Adopted Slack &#8211; over 2 million messages sent out in 2015, WP is one of the largest Slack instances in the world</li>\n<li>WordPress.tv code is now open source</li>\n<li>Localized plugin and theme directories</li>\n<li>All themes and plugins now support language packs</li>\n<li>The plugin directory crossed 1 billion downloads</li>\n<li>Twenty Fifteen theme is the most popular WordPress theme in history: 1.6 million active sites</li>\n<li>205 accessibility tickets completed, an 80% increase from last year</li>\n<li>WordPress had three major releases: 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Mullenweg invited <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/wonderboymusic" target="_blank">Scott Taylor</a>, WordPress 4.4 release lead, to give a brief overview of what&#8217;s coming when the release ships Tuesday, December 8th. This historic release adds the scaffolding of the new WP REST API. It also includes the Twenty Sixteen default theme, responsive images, term meta, and oEmbed for WordPress content.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When WordPress adopts modern technologies, the internet adopts modern technologies,&#8221; Taylor said. He praised the efforts of more than 400 contributors who made 4.4 possible.</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">At <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/wcus?src=hash">#wcus</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/wonderboymusic">@wonderboymusic</a> is presenting 4.4  during the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/sotw?src=hash">#sotw</a>. <img src="http://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/72x72/1f389.png" alt="?" class="wp-smiley" /> <a href="https://t.co/bc5rMOau5B">pic.twitter.com/bc5rMOau5B</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; Matt Mullenweg (@photomatt) <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt/status/673269117953048576">December 5, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>Mullenweg also announced release leads for 2016:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4.5 &#8211; <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/dh-shredder" target="_blank">Mike Schroder</a></li>\n<li>4.6 &#8211; <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/ocean90" target="_blank">Dominik Schilling</a></li>\n<li>4.7 &#8211; <a href="https://profiles.wordpress.org/matt" target="_blank">Matt Mullenweg</a></li>\n</ul>\n<h2>JavaScript Interfaces and PHP APIs are the Future of WordPress</h2>\n<p>Mullenweg&#8217;s address focused heavily on the the opportunities that the WP REST API is opening up for JavaScript-powered applications to run on top of WordPress. He highlighted four examples, including Microsoft Dynamics AX, <a href="https://nomadbase.io/">Nomadbase.io</a>, <a href="https://storycorps.org/" target="_blank">StoryCorps</a>, and WordPress.com&#8217;s new architecture codenamed <a href="http://wptavern.com/early-reviews-show-applications-like-calypso-are-the-future-of-wordpress" target="_blank">Calypso</a>.</p>\n<p>&#8220;They say that the best way to predict the future is to create it,&#8221; he said. This was the motivation behind the Calypso project, which answers the question: <em>&#8220;What would it look like if we designed WP admin completely from scratch?&#8221;</em></p>\n<p>Calypso is 100% JavaScript leveraging React, a totally new technology stack for Mullenweg&#8217;s collection of world class PHP-only developers. They all learned JavaScript in order to create a completely new approach to architecting WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">I believe quite strongly that JavaScript and API-driven interfaces are the future of not just WordPress but the web</span>,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;Perhaps there could be a future where there might be something on the other side that is worth breaking backwards compatibility for.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Despite this new push for JavaScript, Mullenweg emphasized that PHP is not going away. &#8220;So much of the success of WordPress is due to the technologies it was built on,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>While new versions of PHP historically haven&#8217;t provided compelling reasons for people to upgrade, Mullenweg said that PHP7 changes all of that since it&#8217;s twice as fast as its predecessors. This means that a good chunk of the web will soon be doubling in speed.</p>\n<h2>WordPress as an Advocate of the Open Web</h2>\n<p>Mullenweg reaffirmed his strong belief in an open web during his address. As WordPress becomes more JavaScript and API-driven, the platform is better positioned to be a strong advocate of open web principles in terms of publishing access and formats, freedoms, interoperability of open APIs, and device access.</p>\n<p>&#8220;In some ways we are at a nadir of the open web,&#8221; Mullenweg said, noting that big players like Twitter have APIs that are getting more closed off. WordPress stands as a beacon in a sea of threats to digital freedom with its commitment to open APIs that work together.</p>\n<p>&#8220;An API is the key of an open web,&#8221; he said. &#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">WordPress can and will reverse the trend of closed APIs</span>. We&#8217;re one of the few platforms out there where it can be open in every layer of the stack.&#8221;</p>\n<h3>What&#8217;s Ahead for WordPress in 2016?</h3>\n<p>WordPress.org contributors will continue working on getting the top plugins and themes available in every language, which Mullenweg considers to be an &#8220;incredible opportunity to democratize the web.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He also noted that WordPress is still weak on customization. The project will need all hands on deck to move this feature forward in 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;<span class="pullquote alignleft">Customization is the single biggest opportunity for improving the WordPress experience</span>,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg encouraged plugin developers to consider building JavaScript powered interfaces moving forward. In fact, he gave a homework assignment to all in attendance: &#8220;Learn JavaScript, deeply.&#8221;</p>\n<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" width="550"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Homework assignment from <a href="https://twitter.com/photomatt">@photomatt</a>: Learn JavaScript, deeply. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/WCUS?src=hash">#WCUS</a> <a href="https://t.co/VHr2p4JB1O">pic.twitter.com/VHr2p4JB1O</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; WordCamp US (@WordCampUS) <a href="https://twitter.com/WordCampUS/status/673276970977902593">December 5, 2015</a></p></blockquote>\n<p></p>\n<p>He emphasized that JavaScript is not only the future of WordPress but it&#8217;s also the future of the web. &#8220;It&#8217;s what&#8217;s going to allow WordPress to thrive for the next 13 years,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg said that he hopes WordPress developers will be inspired to become world-class JavaScript developers comparable to those in any other JS-powered open source project. A year of learning is ahead. Many developers will become reacquainted with what it feels like to be a beginner, including Mullenweg himself who pledged to contribute a JavaScript patch to core in 2016.</p>\n<p>&#8220;When WordPress launched, the biggest criticism is that the world already had too many blogging systems,&#8221; Mullenweg said. But the world didn&#8217;t yet have a blogging platform with the same philosophical underpinnings that early WordPress contributors embraced.</p>\n<p>A commitment to freedom and openness is WordPress&#8217; true north, and it&#8217;s the reason the platform continues to dominate in 2015. Throughout its evolution as a blogging system to a full CMS, and now an application platform, WordPress continues to evolve towards being more open.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I think we can use this opening up, API-driven development to actually open up more of the web,&#8221; Mullenweg said. &#8220;We have a very exciting year ahead of us making the web a more open place.&#8221;</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sun, 06 Dec 2015 20:45:38 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:17;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:36:"Post Status: State of the Word, 2015";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"https://poststatus.com/?p=15150";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:46:"https://poststatus.com/state-of-the-word-2015/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:9983:"<p>The State of the Word started differently this year, with a formal introduction of Mullenweg by Philadelphia city councilman David Oh. December 5th is being recognized by the city council as &#8220;WordPress Day&#8221; for the city of Philadelphia.</p>\n<p>This is the tenth ever State of the Word. Matt teased the councilman, by calling himself Matt Mullenburg, as the councilman first introduced him.</p>\n<p>The top four sponsors (Jetpack, WooThemes, Bluehost, and Sucuri) donated more than $275,000 to make the first WCUS happen. I understand the full budget for the event was close to half a million dollars.</p>\n<h3>Looking back</h3>\n<p>Matt started his talk by focusing on Thanksgiving and how much we have to be thankful for. He also paused for a moment of silence for Alex King and Kim Parsell, both whom were influential community members and passed away this year.</p>\n<p>WCUS is the biggest WordCamp ever, with 1801 tickets sold. He walked through each WordCamp SF, prior to WCUS&#8217;s existence, and compared the event to how the dashboard looked at the same time.</p>\n<h3>Milestones release</h3>\n<p>Next week, <a href="https://github.com/wordpress/book">Milestones: The Story of WordPress</a> will be released officially. Written by Siobhan McKeown, the book was under development for a year and will continue to be iterated on.</p>\n<h3>Community milestones in 2015</h3>\n<h4>WordCamps</h4>\n<p>There have been 89 WordCamps in the world this year, with over 21,000 attendees from thirty-four countries. There were also over 40,000 people whom attended more than two thousand events.</p>\n<h4>WordPress.org and tooling improvements</h4>\n<p>The WordPress.org website has moved to, &#8220;a more activity based&#8221; metric system, so that now both themes and plugins show active installs.</p>\n<p>Also, Slack is now the primary live communication tool for the WordPress project, with over 2 million messages sent in the past year.</p>\n<p>WordPress.tv code is being redesigned and the code for it will be open source, which is true for most WordPress projects these days.</p>\n<h4>Translations</h4>\n<p>The plugin directory is available in more languages now, and all themes and plugins support language packs, which allows translation to happen at a community level, and doesn&#8217;t require shipping translations as part of the plugin package.</p>\n<h4>Plugin activity</h4>\n<p>Over 9,000 plugins were added to the official repo in 2015, and they have cumulatively downloaded more than 1 billion times since the start of the repo.</p>\n<p>WordPress passed a milestone recently, and now powers 25% of all websites in the world.</p>\n<h3>WordPress Releases in 2015</h3>\n<p>Three releases have occurred since the State of the Word last October: WordPress 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3. And WordPress 4.4 is due on Tuesday, December 8th. The three month schedule has proven successful for WordPress.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>4.1 was led by John Blackbourn</li>\n<li>4.2 was led by Drew Jaynes</li>\n<li>4.3 was led by Konstantin Obenland</li>\n<li>4.4 is being lead by Scott Taylor</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>WordPress 4.4</h3>\n<p>Scott was invited on stage to talk about WordPress 4.4.</p>\n<p>WordPress 4.4 will have many long awaited developer features, including responsive images, term meta and the first half of the WordPress REST API, as well as user facing features like oEmbed for posts and the release of the Twenty Sixteen default theme.</p>\n<p>I like what Scott said about responsive images, when he noted that, <span class="pullquote alignright">&#8220;When WordPress adopts modern technologies, the Internet adopts modern technologies.&#8221;</span> WordPress&#8217;s marketshare allows the core team to be a leader in enabling great new features on the web.</p>\n<h3>Bluehost updates for WordPress and PHP</h3>\n<p>80% of Bluehost&#8217;s more than 2 million websites were not on the latest WordPress version last year. They created a scanning process looking for out of date WordPress websites and helping guide automated updates for those websites. <span class="pullquote alignright">They were able to update almost all websites to the latest version, and it created only a minimal level of support to do so.</span></p>\n<p>Updating WordPress and PHP aren&#8217;t the same thing though.</p>\n<p>I interviewed a team member of Bluehost about this and will have more on it in a podcast. However, Bluehost and other hosts are going to work together to maintain a script that would allow for updating PHP as well as WordPress, and to do so without breaking websites.</p>\n<h3>Upcoming WordPress release leads</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>WordPress 4.5: Mike Schroder</li>\n<li>WordPress 4.6: Dominik Schilling</li>\n<li>WordPress 4.7: Matt Mullenweg</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Six new committers have been added so far in 2015, and seven new committers were announced today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Mike Schroder</li>\n<li>Mel Choyce</li>\n<li>Eric Lewis</li>\n<li>Joe Hoyle</li>\n<li>Rachel Baker</li>\n<li>Pascal Birchler</li>\n<li>Michael Arestad</li>\n</ul>\n<h3>Featured WordPress projects</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of awesome WordPress projects, and Matt highlighted some.</p>\n<h3>REST API in action</h3>\n<ul>\n<li>Microsoft Dynamics AX is a project by WebDevStudios that uses the WordPress REST API to interface between Dynamics AX and the web.</li>\n<li><a href="http://nomadbase.io">NomadBase</a>: A tool built by Human Made to allow for checking in and updating your location all over the world. It&#8217;s built with Mapbox and React to allow for a JavaScript frontend and the WordPress Backend.</li>\n<li><a href="https://storycorps.me">StoryCorps</a>: StoryCorps uses the REST API as the connecting piece between a mobile app and the website, to allow people to create stories by interviewing their family, and uploading them through the app. I did a <a href="https://poststatus.com/how-storycorps-uses-wordpress-to-enable-storytelling-everywhere/">feature on this project</a> earlier this year, and interviewed a member of the StoryCorps team.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Matt looked back at a previous state of the word, where he anticipated WordPress could be better utilized as an app platform. Today, he notes that this is happening, and in many cases it is due to the WordPress REST API</p>\n<h4>Calypso</h4>\n<p>Matt spent some time discussing Calypso, which is the name of the project behind the new WordPress.com web interface and a native Mac App.</p>\n<p>Calypso is a single page application that&#8217;s built with JavaScript, using a Node.js web layer and React. You can find more on Calypso both on the post I wrote <a href="https://poststatus.com/wordpress-com-mac-app/">about the launch</a>, as well as an<a href="https://poststatus.com/interviews-matt-mullenweg/"> interview I did with Matt</a> about the project.</p>\n<p>Calypso is already having an impact on conversations happening about WordPress, and will likely be influential for years to come, especially as more PHP-first developers better learn a JavaScript-centric development approach. Dozens of Automattic employees learned JavaScript during the development of Calypso.</p>\n<h3>JavaScript and APIs in WordPress&#8217;s future</h3>\n<p>Matt said, &#8220;I believe that JavaScript and API-driven interfaces are the future.&#8221; While he doesn&#8217;t think PHP is going anywhere, and WordPress will always have many PHP components, he notes many of the benefits of JavaScript centric development.</p>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignright">&#8220;There might be something on the other side that&#8217;s worth breaking backwards compatibility for,&#8221;</span> Matt said in regard to how important he thinks enabling a faster JavaScript-driven experience is for WordPress.</p>\n<p>Matt spent some time discussing the importance of API driven development as a key to an open web.</p>\n<p>With the scaffolding layer of WordPress 4.4, themes and plugins can register their own endpoints and expose all sorts of data and functionality to external apps.</p>\n<h3>Launches that affect WordPress</h3>\n<p>A couple of cool projects have launched just this week that will affect WordPress.</p>\n<h4>Going SSL with LetsEncrypt</h4>\n<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/">LetsEncrypt</a> is a project that just launched that makes enabling SSL on the web free. With SSL certificates from LetsEncrypt, a significant burden has been lifted in the process for better securing the web.</p>\n<h4>PHP 7</h4>\n<p><a href="http://php.net/archive/2015.php#id2015-12-03-1">PHP 7</a> just launched, and Matt calls it the most significant version of PHP that has shipped since the start of WordPress. PHP 7 is faster than any other PHP ever, and has better stability upon upgrade than pretty much any other version bump.</p>\n<h3>Languages and WordPress</h3>\n<p>Translations and various elements of multi-lingual support have been a trend for years in WordPress.</p>\n<p>Language packs were introduced to core in WordPress 3.7, and now language packs are available for all themes and plugins. Matt announced that the team behind <a href="http://translate.wordpress.org">Translate.WordPress.org</a> is working to translate the top 100 plugins and themes in every available language.</p>\n<h3>Customization</h3>\n<p>WordPress&#8217;s first single page application was the Customizer. Matt believes the customization experience in WordPress will be incredibly important for improving the new user experience of WordPress.</p>\n<h3>Homework: learn JavaScript</h3>\n<p>Matt says he has homework for us: &#8220;Learn JavaScript, Deeply.&#8221; He says he&#8217;ll also follow his own advice, and learn JavaScript himself, which he&#8217;ll prove by committing code to WordPress that&#8217;s JavaScript based &#8212; by 4.7. He gives himself a healthy amount of time to learn, and it will be incredibly important for all WordPress developers to do.</p>\n<h3>WordCamp 2016: December 2nd &#8211; 4th</h3>\n<p>Matt closed by saying that Philadelphia will host the second WordCamp US as well, on December 2nd &#8211; 4th of 2016.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Sat, 05 Dec 2015 23:07:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:18;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:26:"Matt: PHP7 and LetsEncrypt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:21:"http://ma.tt/?p=45684";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:42:"http://ma.tt/2015/12/php7-and-letsencrypt/";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:625:"<p><a href="https://letsencrypt.org/2015/12/03/entering-public-beta.html">LetsEncrypt is available as a beta</a> so everyone can have free SSL, and <a href="http://andigutmans.com/2015/12/03/the-web-is-about-to-get-2x-faster-engineering-heroism-at-its-best/">PHP7 is released which will double the speed of many PHP apps</a>, including WordPress.

I just need the easiest way to create a powerful REST API.</p>\n<p>As the technology around WordPress continues to evolve, Bachhuber sees WordPress as the representation of a set of ideals.</p>\n<p>&#8220;I believe WordPress is the embodiment of core philosophies, rather than a specific manifestation of software: ownership over personal data, design for the users, commitment to backwards compatibility, etc.,&#8221; Bachhuber said.</p>\n<p>&#8220;To get to 100%, WordPress needs to interoperate with every part of the web.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Bachhuber will be working on the project during the first six months of 2016. He plans to post bi-weekly progress updates to the WP-CLI blog and will cross-post to Kickstarter as well.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 04 Dec 2015 02:58:02 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:21;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:71:"WPTavern: WPWeekly Episode 215 – All About Logos With Andrew Bergeron";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:44:"http://wptavern.com?p=49295&preview_id=49295";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:77:"http://wptavern.com/wpweekly-episode-215-all-about-logos-with-andrew-bergeron";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2985:"<p>In this episode, <a href="http://marcuscouch.com/">Marcus Couch</a> and I are joined by Andrew Bergeron, founder of <a href="http://visualrhythm.com/">Visual Rhythm. </a>Bergeron explains the effort and investment it takes to create memorable logos.

Since 3.0&#8217;s release on November 18th, the development team <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/changelog/">has released </a>six point releases.</p>\n<p>Joost de Valk, founder of <a href="https://yoast.com/">Yoast.com</a>, and lead developer of WordPress SEO, <a href="https://yoast.com/yoast-seo-3-0-release-a-recap/">explains</a> the mistakes made with the release and apologizes for the lack of communication, &#8220;We’ve made mistakes, obviously. Of course, there were bugs, which we have worked hard on and are still working on right now. We’ve made mistakes in communication too. We’re sorry about that,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/">WordPress SEO</a> is active on more than a million sites and the fallout from issues experienced by users upgrading to the 3.0 branch has resulted in <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/view/plugin-reviews/wordpress-seo?filter=1">many negative reviews</a>. Over time, the plugin has <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/topic/too-many-updates-instead-of-one-stable-release#post-">gained a reputation</a> of breaking with each upgrade.</p>\n<h2>More Beta Testers Needed</h2>\n<p>de Valk admits that when 3.0 was pushed out to the public, users would encounter bugs, but says it&#8217;s part of having a large variety of configurations across their install base, &#8220;There were a few bugs that I think we should’ve caught in our testing period which was extensive and we’re taking precautions to make sure we do next time,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Despite the <a href="https://yoast.com/dev-blog/road-to-yoast-seo-3-0/">roadmap to Yoast SEO 3.0</a> published in November, the amount of people who tested the releases was small compared to every day users. The team is asking for ideas on how to encourage more people to participate in the beta testing process.</p>\n<h2>Communication Breakdown</h2>\n<p>de Valk and his team of five actively responded to users on Twitter and email but didn&#8217;t immediately address users on Facebook which led to harsh criticism. Paying customers were prioritized while free users were told that they wouldn&#8217;t be supported over email.</p>\n<p>de Valk admits it was probably the wrong course of action, &#8220;This was probably, in hindsight, not what we should’ve done. For future major releases we will try to actively support <em>everybody</em> for a period of time,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<h2>It’s Difficult to Change a Reputation</h2>\n<p>He also addresses the usability issues caused by changes to the user interface of the snippet editor, &#8220;We thought the interface was intuitive, we also thought people would watch that (30 second) video, but we were obviously wrong. We’re now thinking about how to improve the snippet editor so it’s more obvious <em>how</em> you are able to edit,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>The issues experienced by people upgrading WordPress SEO is a good example as to why automatically updating plugins is a bad idea. While the team continues to work hard to fix issues in the 3.0 branch, it&#8217;s going to take a number of excellent releases to erode the negative reputation that WordPress SEO upgrades will either break functionality or the site that&#8217;s using it.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 02 Dec 2015 23:29:36 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:24;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: Freemius Insights Enables Plugin Developers to Make Data-Driven Decisions";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=49239";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://wptavern.com/freemius-insights-enables-plugin-developers-to-make-data-driven-decisions";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:10614:"<p>The WordPress plugin directory gives authors a set of statistics but many are left wanting more. <a href="http://freemius.com/wordpress/insights/">Freemius Insights,</a> is a new service founded by <a href="https://twitter.com/vovafeldman">Vova Feldman</a>, that allows authors to accumulate detailed statistics from users.</p>\n<p>Feldman and his team of four, created the service after speaking to more than 100 plugin developers and realizing there&#8217;s a huge gap between what WordPress authors have in terms of data, compared to what web and mobile products have in the market.</p>\n<h2>Up Front Opt-in</h2>\n<p>According to the WordPress <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/about/guidelines/">plugin directory guidelines</a>, plugins are not allowed to phone home.

Knowing the sites a plugin is activated on is valuable data. For example, if a plugin is used on Microsoft.com, the developer can leverage that information to possibly establish a one to one relationship. <span class="_5yl5">Developers can also create up sells to those specific sites.</span></p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightssites.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49242"><img class="size-full wp-image-49242" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightssites.png?resize=1025%2C709" alt="Sites the Plugin is Activated On" /></a>Sites the Plugin is Activated On\n<p><span class="_5yl5">Freemius Insights also uses this data to automatically send an email if a user uninstalls the plugin within the first hour after installation. The email template is personalized with the user&#8217;s name and site address. It asks for feedback on how the plugin can be improved or why it didn&#8217;t meet their needs.<br />\n</span></p>\n<p>Developers can even dive deep into a site&#8217;s activity and view recent events associated with their plugin such as updates, installs, activation, and who initiated the action. You can see the site&#8217;s language, PHP version, and a variety of other data.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightssite.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49243"><img class="size-full wp-image-49243" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightssite.png?resize=1025%2C917" alt="Detailed Site View" /></a>Detailed Site View\n<p>If you want to know the names of the people who opted in, you can see that too. Since Freemius Insights collects a user&#8217;s email address, developers can interact with users on an individual level instead of broadcasting emails.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightsusers.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49244"><img class="size-full wp-image-49244" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiusInsightsusers.png?resize=1025%2C709" alt="See Who Opted In" /></a>See Who Opted In\n<h2>Receiving Feedback at a Critical Time</h2>\n<p>One of the most annoying things plugin developers face are one star reviews with no explanation behind the review. Based on data collected during the beta testing process, Feldman discovered that more than 20% of the users who install a plugin will uninstall it within the first 15 minutes.</p>\n<p>Freemius Insights has a Deactivation Feedback Form. This form appears when a user deactivates the plugin and gives users an opportunity to explain why they deactivated it.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightsdeactivation-form.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49245"><img class="size-full wp-image-49245" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightsdeactivation-form.png?resize=1025%2C759" alt="Deactivation Form" /></a>Deactivation Form\n<p>This could be annoying if you&#8217;re deactivating a plugin to troubleshoot WordPress but Feldman explains why the form is tied to the deactivation procedure, &#8220;O<span class="_5yl5">nce the user deactivates the plugin, the plugin can&#8217;t modify anything in the dashboard.</span></p>\n<p><span class="_5yl5">The data is not sent until the plugin is deleted. If the user provides feedback, it&#8217;s stored locally in the database. When a user proceeds with the deletion process, it fires the uninstall hook and sends the data to the server,&#8221; he said.<br />\n</span></p>\n<h2>Reasons Why Users Uninstall a Plugin</h2>\n<p>In general, people <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negativity_bias">give negative</a> feedback more than positive. During the beta testing period, Freemius Insights witnessed more than a 82% conversion rate with the feedback form. This data is invaluable to developers and can be viewed on the Insights dashboard.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightsDetailedStats.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49247"><img class="size-full wp-image-49247" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/FreemiumInsightsDetailedStats.png?resize=385%2C197" alt="Reasons Why Users Deactivated The Plugin" /></a>Reasons Why Users Deactivated The Plugin\n<p>Although Other is not helpful in this chart, it&#8217;s valuable because it represents how many users chose to provide custom feedback. It reinforces the fact that users are more than willing to tell developers what&#8217;s wrong if given the opportunity. Developers can also filter sites by Uninstalls to get a deeper understanding as to why a specific user uninstalled the plugin.</p>\n<h2>Webhooks for Developers</h2>\n<p>Freemius Insights has a webhooks mechanism built-in that enables developers to forward events to another location. For example, when a user installs a plugin, the developer can push the user&#8217;s email address into MailChimp. Another example is when a user upgrades a plugin, you can send them an email that lists new features in that version.</p>\n<h2>Free and Paid Subscription Plans</h2>\n<p>Freemius Insights has a free plan available to developers of free plugins.

Feldman explains the benefits of a hands-on approach:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>We want to be in control of our scale. Analytics requires a significant amount of storage and performance. If one of the most popular plugins joins the service without a heads up, it might drain our server&#8217;s resources and affect the performance of the rest of our users.</li>\n<li>FTUE (first-time user experience) is crucial for every service. Signing into an empty dashboard might make the wrong impression, and we know the first impression is critical. Therefore, we prefer to demo the platform by showing real data from our plugin.</li>\n<li>We believe the personal touch is more than a cliché. We are willing to spend time getting to know each developer we work with, building a personal relationship, and making sure every integration is a success story. We also love to learn new things, and user feedback is extremely valuable to us.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Feldman says Insights is for plugin developers who want to make data driven decisions, &#8220;Freemius Insights provides ad-hoc data so developers don&#8217;t have to base decisions on gut instinct.&#8221;</p>\n<h2>Out of Beta</h2>\n<p>Freemius Insights is out of beta and today marks the first opportunity the public has to see Insights in action.

The video was recorded Tuesday, November 24 and published over the weekend.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg offers a hands-on tour of the new reader, notifications, and editor and explains WordPress.com&#8217;s new architecture for audience members who are not development-oriented. He also explains how the desktop client and browser version were developed simultaneously so that WordPress.com can continue to iterate just as quickly as it has in the past, with developers committing new code 140+ times per day.</p>\n<p>If you can&#8217;t get enough of WordPress vs. Medium comparisons, then this episode is for you. When asked if he sees Medium as a competitor to WordPress, Mullenweg replied, &#8220;In some ways we compete with every place that people publish online, even Twitter or Facebook, but in day to day, that competition doesn&#8217;t really drive product decisions and for most people what we provide is pretty distinct from what these other platforms have.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Later in the episode Mullenweg is asked, &#8220;What are the holes still left unfilled in publishing?&#8221;</p>\n<p>&#8220;Publishing is still so mediocre,&#8221; he replied. &#8220;Some of the best stuff Medium did is around their editor. I think the whole writing/collaboration experience can be significantly better than it is today.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Mullenweg elaborates on the differences between WordPress.com and Medium&#8217;s user base and his vision for where Automattic will take Calypso in the future.

One of the event&#8217;s highlights is Matt Mullenweg&#8217;s State of the Word presentation. In it, Mullenweg shares data on WordPress&#8217; growth throughout the year and gives insight to where the project is heading.</p>\n<p>About a week before his presentation, Mullenweg asks members of the WordPress community for feedback. Questions include:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>What are the things you&#8217;re most proud of WordPress or people in the community doing over the past year?</li>\n<li>Have there been people who you feel have influenced the project in a big way, including yourself, and how?</li>\n<li>What do you think we should focus on and work on the most in the next year?</li>\n<li>Any stories you&#8217;ve heard with or around WordPress that you think deserve being highlighted?</li>\n<li>Anything else?</li>\n</ol>\n<p>This year, the most important question he asks is number five. Each year during the State of the Word, Mullenweg highlights new and existing contributors and we as a community cheer and celebrate them. This year, we&#8217;ve lost some incredibly talented and important people in the community.</p>\n<p>I suggest that Mullenweg adds one slide to his presentation that remembers the lives of those lost in the community this year. The slide should have Gravatars or photos and the names of those who passed away. Here are a few people who would be on the slide.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href="http://wptavern.com/kim-parsell-affectionately-known-as-wpmom-passes-away">Kim Parsell</a></li>\n<li><a href="http://wptavern.com/alex-king-founder-of-crowd-favorite-passes-away">Alex King</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://mattreport.com/honoring-clint-warren/">Clint Warren</a></li>\n<li><a href="https://twitter.com/wordcampmiami/status/561953493360336896">Jacqueline Jiminez</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>If you&#8217;re in favor of this idea and know someone in the WordPress community who passed away this year, please leave a comment with their name and if possible, a link to their obituary.</p>\n<p>WordPress is a 12-year-old open source software project that will likely survive long after the people who help maintain it pass on. Adding a slide to the State of the Word that remembers contributors who passed away during the year is a small price to pay. It also humanizes the software and serves as a reminder that without contributors, WordPress wouldn&#8217;t exist.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 20:22:55 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:28;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:82:"WPTavern: Early Reviews Show Applications Like Calypso Are the Future of WordPress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=49161";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://wptavern.com/early-reviews-show-applications-like-calypso-are-the-future-of-wordpress";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6086:"<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/calypso.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49205"><img src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/calypso.png?resize=900%2C475" alt="calypso" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49205" /></a></p>\n<p>Last week <a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-unveils-open-source-wordpress-desktop-application-for-the-mac" target="_blank">Automattic unveiled Project Calypso</a>, a brand new architecture for WordPress.com and a <a href="https://desktop.wordpress.com/" target="_blank">Mac app</a> that mirrors the experience on desktop. The overhaul was nearly two years in the making, a risky bet for Automattic but one that shows a glimpse of what the future of WordPress could be.</p>\n<p>The new JavaScript and REST API-powered WordPress.com technologically pivots the platform into a lithe modern publishing engine while shedding 10 years of legacy code in the process. It&#8217;s easy to see why Calypso has so far received <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/calypso-24-hours-later/" target="_blank">glowing reviews</a> from news outlets around the web. The <a href="https://developer.files.wordpress.com/2015/11/whats-new-wpcom2.pdf" target="_blank">giant technological leap forward</a> results in a publishing experience that is a night-and-day difference when it comes to page loads, content previewing, and real-time updating.</p>\n<p>In an <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2015/11/24/wordpress-creator-matt-mullenweg-breaks-down-the-blogging-platforms-biggest-overhaul-in-years/" target="_blank">interview with VentureBeat</a>, Matt Mullenweg answers a burning question that the community wants to know &#8211; <em>What does Calypso mean for WordPress core?</em> Will core adopt a similar technology stack? Mullenweg sees Calypso as just one example of what is possible with WordPress.</p>\n<blockquote><p>So I think what might happen is that the technology that drives the server side of WordPress and what drives the client side can diverge. Again, this is really up to the community, so we’ll see where it takes us. This thing we released has only been out there one day. Maybe someone will make something much better?</p></blockquote>\n<p>WordPress.com&#8217;s new architecture isn&#8217;t the first case of &#8220;headless WordPress,&#8221; though it is one of the most prominent and easiest examples for users to demo. Many other WordPress-powered sites have already adopted an approach that decouples the interface using the new WP REST API. Apps like <a href="https://storycorps.me/" target="_blank">StoryCorps</a>, <a href="http://nomadbase.io/" target="_blank">Nomadbase</a>, the New York Times, and the <a href="http://www.wired.com/2015/09/apple-liveblog-iphone-apple-tv-news/" target="_blank">Wired.com liveblog</a> are a few early pioneers using the API to deliver content.</p>\n<p>Another example offered in the <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-story-behind-the-new-wordpress-com/#comment-7275" target="_blank">comments</a> on the WordPress.com developer blog cites <a href="https://ustwo.com/" target="_blank">ustwo.com</a> (the makers of Monument Valley, Dice, and other popular apps) as using a similar setup. The site is a <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/" target="_blank">React.js</a> single-page application that serves WordPress content via the WP REST API using custom endpoints. Like WordPress.com, the code for this site is also <a href="https://github.com/ustwo/ustwo.com-frontend" target="_blank">open source on GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>Despite the risk of sharing the large innovative codebase with competitors, Automattic opted to keep Calypso open and available for anyone in the WordPress community to learn from and build upon.</p>\n<p>&#8220;A lot of people thought we should keep this proprietary, but throughout my life I’ve learned that the more you give away, the more you get back,&#8221; Mullenweg said in his <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/" target="_blank">announcement</a>.</p>\n<p>Within the first 24 hours the <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso" target="_blank">repo</a> was already <a href="https://github.com/trending" target="_blank">trending on GitHub</a>, with developers eagerly reviewing the code. ManageWP, a competitor to Jetpack Manage, <a href="https://managewp.com/will-calypso-change-game" target="_blank">praised Calypso</a> as an important tool to help drive up WordPress marketshare and move the platform forward:</p>\n<blockquote><p>That’s the beauty of WordPress – the Foundation is not looking to put us under Automattic’s thumb; Matt and his team are actively encouraging the WordPress community, through open source policy, to keep building, innovating, making lives easier for everyone, and find their own place in the ecosystem.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Automattic&#8217;s commitment to open sourcing its code demonstrates that any innovations they release are not designed to eclipse competitors&#8217; efforts but rather to add to the shared knowledge bank that drives WordPress improvements.</p>\n<p>Mullenweg, in a <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/calypso-24-hours-later/" target="_blank">roundup of press on Calypso</a>, brings it back to the core value of democratizing publishing.</p>\n<p>&#8220;At the end of the day, it’s not about technology for technology’s sake, it’s about technology at the service of human voices,&#8221; he said. &#8220;Embracing change to support the free, open web where everyone has a voice.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Calypso is one of the best new examples of having WordPress your way. It demonstrates the flexibility of using a REST API to run any kind of JavaScript application on top of WordPress while maintaining the use of its world class CMS features. Greater architectural freedom for developers means more compelling publishing experiences for users. The success of the open source Calypso project will likely pave the way for many more JavaScript and REST API-powered WordPress sites and desktop applications.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 30 Nov 2015 19:29:00 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Sarah Gooding";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:29;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:103:"WPTavern: New WordPress Plugin Replaces Hello Dolly Lyrics With Random Quotes From Star Wars Characters";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=49194";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:113:"http://wptavern.com/new-wordpress-plugin-replaces-hello-dolly-lyrics-with-random-quotes-from-star-wars-characters";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:1848:"<p>On <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/releaseinfo">December 18th</a>, fans across the U.S. will flock to movie theaters to watch <a href="http://www.imdb.com/title/tt2488496/">Star Wars: The Force Awakens</a>.

Lema shares his experience beta testing a Windows version of Automattic&#8217;s new desktop application. We discuss how WordPress is going to grow its market share from 25% to 50% and how important Jetpack is to reaching that goal. Near the end of the interview, Lema shares what he&#8217;s most thankful for as it relates to WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Stories Discussed:</h2>\n<p><a href="http://wptavern.com/automattic-unveils-open-source-wordpress-desktop-application-for-the-mac">Automattic Unveils Open Source WordPress.com Desktop Application for the Mac</a></p>\n<h2>Plugins Picked By Marcus:</h2>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-tao/">WP TAO</a> by Michal Jaworski and Damian Gora from Poland, is a free powerful WordPress plugin for tracking website visitors. It allows you to identify your users and keep track of their activities in an easy to read digital dashboard and log format.</p>\n<p><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/cool-timeline/">Cool Timeline</a> is Narinder Singh&#8217;s first plugin in the repository.

I’m struggling with my health and maintaining a schedule as a distributed worker. A dear WordPress friend of mine (Kim Parsell) passed away at the beginning of the year. My grandma was recently diagnosed with lung cancer and I’ve been dealing with wild swings between feeling positive and downright depressed.</p>\n<p>The thing I’m most thankful for this year as it relates to WordPress are the people who make up the community. Some are personal friends, others live on the other side of the world. Their consistent reinforcement of positive vibes has helped me get through some turbulent times in my life this year. To everyone who has and continues to give me encouragement, advice, and positive reinforcement, thank you.</p>\n<h2>What Marcus is Thankful For:</h2>\n<p>This year was one of the hardest years for me in terms of professional struggles and hardships. I lost relatives and friends, a job, and had to start from square one. I had a lot of support from within the WordPress community coming really close to working with a few people directly. In the end, it was my WordPress skills that landed me a new gig, which I now call <em>The Dream Gig</em>.</p>\n<p>I’m thankful for the opportunities to meet people from within the WordPress community in real life. From Chris Lema and Cory Miller to Jeff Chandler and beyond. Every time I meet someone, they not only share their successes, but their struggles. It’s good to know that I’m not the only one and be able to use their strength and perseverance to fuel my drive and passion for WordPress.</p>\n<p>I’m thankful for the opportunity to share what I know to thousands of people around the world. I feel the best sense of accomplishment when I receive an email from someone that&#8217;s stuck on a particular problem and discovers a solution after they hear me talk about a plugin or technique on a podcast. It’s a great outlet for me personally that I hope to continue for many more years to come. Thanks to all who are listening and to those who are listening for the first time.</p>\n<h2>WPWeekly Meta:</h2>\n<p><strong>Next Episode:</strong> Wednesday, December 2nd 9:30 P.M.

If you like the show, I&#8217;d highly appreciate if you share it with your friends and colleagues.</p>\n<h3>Why did you make such a big bet on Calypso?</h3>\n<p>Matt has talked for a while now about his vision that WordPress can become an &#8220;app platform,&#8221; and this is an example of what that meant to him.</p>\n<p>He also notes how he&#8217;s always  looking for things that will &#8220;move the needle&#8221; for greater WordPress adoption. We were both thinking about the same statistic: that <a href="https://poststatus.com/2013-state-of-the-word-from-matt-mullenweg/">roughly 96% of WordPress.com users</a> (and probably a high number of WordPress.org users too) essentially abandon their websites after a short tenure. So anything that can increase that number, to say 8% or 15% of folks that stick with it long term, can make a huge difference.</p>\n<h3>How do you think about investing in feature development for WordPress.com, and how it affects WordPress as well?</h3>\n<p>When Matt considers where he wants to invest Automattic developer and designer time, he says he thinks of WordPress as a whole first, before considering specifics for WordPress.com. He&#8217;d rather see WordPress.com as a gateway to a self-hosted install. And whether someone stays on .com or moves to a self-hosted install, he wants to help ensure that their problems are solved.</p>\n<h3>WordPresses</h3>\n<p>It&#8217;s new to me, but Matt says he&#8217;s been saying it for years, that he calls WordPress websites &#8220;WordPresses,&#8221; after a long time internal debate about whether to call WordPress.com websites sites or blogs.</p>\n<h3>WordPress.com as a network versus a platform</h3>\n<p>The new homepage for logged in users, or users in the WordPress.com app, defaults to the Reader view of the interface, versus the writing view. This intrigued me, as I don&#8217;t personally think of WordPress.com as a read-first ecosystem, but rather a place to write. I think more of Tumblr or Medium when I think of a destination for reading, where I may also write.</p>\n<p>Matt and I talked about the merits of WordPress as a network versus a platform. He thinks it can be both. And I think this touches on one of the big goals for Calypso that we haven&#8217;t discussed yet: to make WordPress a better network.</p>\n<p>To me, WordPress.com is a platform, but WordPress (both .com and Jetpack enabled sites) are ripe to be a hugely successful network, through the huge number of websites and independent publishers that are interconnected via WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>There is more evidence that this is a goal for them too, with the <a href="https://discover.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/hello-world/">launch of Discover WordPress</a> along with the release of the new interface. Discover WordPress is a project by the editorial team to surface the best writing across WordPress.com and Jetpack enabled websites.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, beyond the human curated content, much could be done in the future algorithmically. We didn&#8217;t get as much into this stuff as I would&#8217;ve liked, but I think it&#8217;s  an enormous growth area for Automattic.</p>\n<h3>Open sourcing Calypso</h3>\n<p>The Calypso <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso">project code</a> is fully open source, and is a top trending project on Github right now. There are few requirements to run the code locally, so you can pretty quickly get a working web view.</p>\n<p>There are a slew of <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/tree/master/client/components">fancy React components</a> that could be pretty easily lifted from Calypso and used independently, as well as a <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso/blob/master/docs/guide/hello-world.md">guide to getting started</a> with the full codebase.</p>\n<h3>How can the community anticipate the future, with more abstracted implementations of WordPress?</h3>\n<p>As WordPress projects continue to use REST APIs to create fully custom frontends, backends, and inbetweens, I was curious what Matt thinks the community can do to anticipate and educate users on how to deal with these scenarios, that may fragment WordPress and be confusing for people who expect WordPress plugins and code to interact well with one another.</p>\n<p>He doesn&#8217;t think it&#8217;s too much of a problem, but says it&#8217;s important that we experiment and learn from our experiments; he was hesitant to call the potential for confusion fragmentation as much as experimentation. Either way, I do think education and documentation will be important as other folks continue to use parts of WordPress to make impressive things, without supporting every specific thing that can <em>also</em> run on WordPress.</p>\n<p>An example of this is the WordPress.com app itself. You can manage Jetpack enabled sites through it, but that doesn&#8217;t mean you get everything in the editor you&#8217;d get with a WordPress.org site, like custom fields and other plugin functionality that the desktop app doesn&#8217;t support.</p>\n<h3>What is Automattic&#8217;s differentiating factor?</h3>\n<p>I wanted to know what Automattic&#8217;s differentiating factor is, in Matt&#8217;s mind. He defaulted, I guess unsurprisingly, to &#8220;everything,&#8221; but as I pushed him a little further, he dug a bit more into some of the things that make Automattic interesting.</p>\n<p>From a self-hosted perspective, WordPress.com integrated tools like Stats, VaultPress, and Akismet are difficult to match with other tools.</p>\n<p>For WordPress.com, he thinks the potential power of the Reader and network can be compelling. I agree there that the diversity of the WordPress.com and Jetpack author audience could make for a compelling Reading product, that has more potential than I see right now in a competitor like Medium, which is quite tech heavy.</p>\n<p>Matt says, <span class="pullquote alignright">&#8220;We&#8217;ve built up a lot of trust in the community, and that goodwill definitely pays back.&#8221;</span> Part of what makes it hard to identify Automattic&#8217;s specific differentiator is that they do a lot of things. Matt acknowledged this, but counters by saying that they work hard on user experience and being a good community citizen.</p>\n<h3>How have teams changed at Automattic over time?</h3>\n<p>Automattic scales by splitting teams when they get too big. Today, there are 46 teams. Some of those teams are embedded in larger teams and have some hierarchy, but the company is still quite flat for a company of 400 people.</p>\n<p>The rule of thumb Matt wants to maintain is that someone should have no more than 10 people that report directly to them, though he has around 23.</p>\n<p>According to the standards of the tech world, Automattic&#8217;s scale in terms of the number of employees may be somewhat ordinary, but they have still had massive and consistent change over the decade of the company&#8217;s existence. And they are hiring as fast as they can to this day.</p>\n<h3>The challenge of customizing WordPress sites</h3>\n<p>A couple of years ago, someone from Automattic told me how concerned they were about the WordPress customizer&#8217;s ability to scale, both for use on mobile devices, and as a utility that could manage a lot of features. And I wanted to know how Matt thinks that has evolved, now that the customizer is in such significant use on both WordPress.com and for self-hosted websites.</p>\n<p>As he notes, the customizer has undergone a lot of positive iteration over the last several releases, and today the WordPress.com and WordPress.org customizers are using the same base code; whereas for a while WordPress.com had their own custom implementation.</p>\n<p>But he still says that, &#8220;If we&#8217;re candid with ourselves, &#8230; customization is still the worst part of WordPress, you know? It&#8217;s the hardest. It&#8217;s where people get stuck. It&#8217;s where there&#8217;s a real gap between the promise and what people are able to realize and create when they get started using WordPress.&#8221;</p>\n<p>It&#8217;s not as much a problem with the use of themes, or if you can code, but for new users, &#8220;it&#8217;s their biggest struggle.&#8221;</p>\n<p>One idea that I have is to have a more Medium-like interface be the &#8220;default&#8221; view, versus a changing default theme. That way, WordPress.com could be more opinionated about the default view, and change the theme at will, or along with trends, versus giving new users the default theme of a particular year and then that theme is untouched unless the user decides to switch.</p>\n<p>Matt said they have that a bit on the Reader view, but that is what someone in the WordPress.com network would see, versus what an outside website visitor would see.</p>\n<p>Anyway, there are definitely challenges ahead for enabling customizations and, more importantly, just ensuring sites look good for users. I think that this is an area where other platforms &#8212; like Medium and Squarespace, though in different ways &#8212; are doing a good job.</p>\n<h3>The first line of the Automattic creed</h3>\n<p>The <a href="http://ma.tt/2011/09/automattic-creed/">Automattic creed</a> states at the very beginning, &#8220;I will never stop learning.&#8221; That was part of Matt&#8217;s response when I asked just how they managed to <a href="http://dentedreality.com.au/2015/11/23/all-new-wordpress-com/">cross-train a workforce</a> that was primarily made of PHP developers to create a world-class JavaScript driven application.</p>\n<p>Additionally to the natural desires that Automattic employees should have to learn, they created internal resources for helping people, and are considering releasing some of that material, maybe in the form of webinars or an online conference.</p>\n<p>Matt said Automatticians will also be sharing what they learn at other conferences, like the upcoming <a href="https://feelingrestful.com/speakers/">A Day of REST</a>, where two Automatticians will be speaking.</p>\n<p>Matt did admit that he hasn&#8217;t made the PHP to JavaScript switch yet, and personally feels more comfortable in PHP; though some of his team have said it wasn&#8217;t as intimidating as it sounds.</p>\n<h3>Bug bounties</h3>\n<p>Did you know all Automattic properties are on <a href="https://hackerone.com/automattic">Hacker One</a>, the bug bounty community? If you find a security bug, you can get a bounty if you report it. I didn&#8217;t know this until the Calypso launch.</p>\n<h3>How is Automattic thinking about revenue?</h3>\n<p>With my napkin math and a few small things I know about Automattic, I&#8217;d guesstimate they are somewhere in the neighborhood of $100 million in annual revenue. I didn&#8217;t even attempt to get confirmation of this, because I know they don&#8217;t reveal this kind of information. So instead I wanted to get more insights of how Matt thinks about revenue at Automattic.</p>\n<p>Generally, he says they put their focus in, &#8220;three main buckets.&#8221; They use that focus both for revenue purposes and product purposes. Those areas are WordPress.com, Jetpack, and WooCommerce.</p>\n<p>They group things like VaultPress and Akismet under Jetpack; so it&#8217;s basically their WordPress.org SaaS revenue stream. Those are paid subscription products.  They have been transitioning that offering, as Matt shared, &#8220;a big trend over the past few years, has been to move away from a la carte upgrades, and have more bundles.&#8221;</p>\n<p>They&#8217;ve discovered that bundled plans of $100 per year and $300 per year have been successful. Here are those plans, for both WordPress.com and WordPress.org, as shown in the new WordPress.com/Calypso interface:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15013" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wp-org-plan.png" alt="wp-org-plan" width="739" height="693" /><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-15014" src="https://cdn.poststatus.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/wpcom-plan.png" alt="wpcom-plan" width="736" height="798" /></p>\n<p>It appears they get most of their revenue from this stream. I do know, and have previously reported, that at least at one point, WordPress.com VIP accounted for upwards of 25% of overall revenue, and though that gross number has gone up over the years, its percentage of overall revenue has gone down, meaning that these paid plans have outpaced VIP, growth-wise. I&#8217;d guess VIP revenue is now less than half of that 25% number now, but can&#8217;t confirm it.</p>\n<h3>Total sites, versus engagement</h3>\n<p>There are a lot of WordPress.com websites, but as Matt noted, it&#8217;s a vanity metric due to the fact that such a small percentage are active, engaged users. So they are trying more to track engagement versus total sites.</p>\n<p>I tried to get him to share the number of active websites, but that&#8217;s not something he could share.</p>\n<h3>Helping site owners monetize, and WooCommerce integration to WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>I talked about the roadmap some, and asked Matt about what they may offer in the future to help authors monetize their sites. They currently have a <a href="https://wordads.co/">WordAds</a> program, but that is a pageview driven strategy, and I&#8217;d love to see them introduce a way for authors to get paid via a tip jar, private paid posts, or subscription system like I&#8217;ve heard Medium is investigating. It&#8217;s not on their current roadmap, but he says he&#8217;d be open to it.</p>\n<p>He also noted that since WooCommerce is now &#8220;part of the family,&#8221; that there may be future monetization opportunities through that, though he said they don&#8217;t have current plans for a hosted version of WooCommerce on WordPress.com. I was honestly pretty surprised by this:</p>\n<blockquote><p>In the beginning, our focus is really going to be on people hosting their stores, you know, with web hosts. Because, part of the beauty of why WooCommerce is so popular is the flexibility, and I don&#8217;t think the usability is there &#8212; yet &#8212; to be competitive with, like, a  Shopify, or a BigCommerce. So, it&#8217;s just a lot of work to do there.</p></blockquote>\n<p><span class="pullquote alignright">Matt said he thinks of WooCommerce as how WordPress was around version 1.5. He called it, &#8220;very early days&#8221;</span>, in that people are using it and see the potential, but says, &#8220;there&#8217;s just so much to work on and improve to make it accessible to a wider audience.&#8221;</p>\n<p>He says the Woo team is now 63 people, and a number of Automatticians are doing &#8220;Wootations,&#8221; or rotations with the Woo team.</p>\n<h3>What to expect next in the new WordPress.com interface</h3>\n<p>They are still working on a lot of things for the new interface. There are certain things that aren&#8217;t there yet. For instance, showing and hiding your sites you are personally attached to still requires the regular admin. I actually experienced this myself. Some parts of the interface are pretty circular and confusing.</p>\n<p>But they plan to do more going forward; their values on the project state that, &#8220;we are here for the long haul.&#8221; They want to see what there is demand for, and what other people do with the open source nature of the project.</p>\n<p>Matt also noted that he&#8217;d like to &#8220;loop back&#8221; to content blocks (code named <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/features-as-plugins/">CEUX</a>) &#8212; the project that stalled last year. And he&#8217;s like to see what can be done around collaboration, editing, and the suggestion process.</p>\n<h3>Power and ease of use</h3>\n<p>One of the biggest challenges for WordPress is to continue to get easier to use, as other avenues for sharing information have gotten easier and easier, while continuing to enable powerful, feature rich implementations of WordPress.</p>\n<p>Matt thinks this balance is important, and that we must continue to improve in both directions to continue WordPress&#8217;s growth.</p>\n<h3>Wrapping up</h3>\n<p>I really enjoyed my first audio interview with Matt. He says we can expect more announcements around WordCamp US, which starts next week.</p>\n<p>The Calypso project is a fascinating one, and it&#8217;s a great example of what we should continue to expect: powerful, catered tools that run on a RESTful API. They aren&#8217;t always going to be tools for use everywhere, but we can expect to continue to see WordPress used in innovative ways, and be an exceptional platform for all kinds of applications.</p>\n<p>And finally, at the end of the interview, I pitched Matt on one of my most harebrained ideas. The naming conflict between WordPress.com and WordPress was really bad with this project, as nearly everyone not deeply embedded within the WordPress world got it wrong, and conflated Automattic&#8217;s WordPress.com with WordPress the software.</p>\n<p>And I think Jetpack&#8217;s brand has really blossomed. I think there is an argument to be made that Automattic could change the name of WordPress.com to Jetpack, and both Automattic and WordPress would win from the change. It wouldn&#8217;t be easy, but all I asked from him, is whether he&#8217;d read my post if I wrote one to give the pitch. He said he would, so expect that sometime soon.</p>\n<p>Thanks to Matt for the interview, and thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/markarms">Mark Armstrong</a> for helping me get going with the new WordPress.com app and arranging the interview.</p>\n<p><a href="http://ma.tt/2013/07/wcsf-contributor-day-2013/">* Photo credit Sheri Bigelow</a></p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Wed, 25 Nov 2015 19:13:27 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:15:"Brian Krogsgard";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:34;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:99:"WPTavern: The WordPress Theme Directory Replaces Download Counts With the Number of Active Installs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=49123";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:109:"http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-theme-directory-replaces-download-counts-with-the-number-of-active-installs";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:3429:"<p>Earlier this year, the <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-plugin-directory-launches-new-design">WordPress plugin directory was redesigned</a>. As part of the redesign, download counts were replaced with the number of Active Installs to reflect more accurate data. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/">WordPress theme directory</a> has finally followed suit by replacing download counts with the number of Active Installs.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ActiveInstallsofTwentyFifteen.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49125"><img class="size-full wp-image-49125" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ActiveInstallsofTwentyFifteen.png?resize=891%2C547" alt="Active Installs of Twenty Fifteen" /></a>Active Installs of Twenty Fifteen\n<p>As you can see from the above screenshot, the Twenty Fifteen default theme included in WordPress 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3, is active on more than one million sites. Active themes are those that are activated and in use on a site. Themes that are installed and not activated are not counted, neither are child themes.</p>\n<p>In the Themereview Slack Channel, Tom Usborne <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1447998481000578">explains why</a> active installs for child themes should be counted.</p>\n<blockquote><p>I think an argument for child themes to be included in the active installs count can be made. For example, we offer a completely blank child theme for our customers so they can make CSS and PHP adjustments. This means our install count isn&#8217;t accurate on w.org, even though those people are using the theme actively.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Dion Hulse, WordPress lead developer, <a href="https://wordpress.slack.com/archives/themereview/p1447998501000579">agrees</a> that child themes should be counted but the team doesn&#8217;t have the data yet. Some theme authors are concerned that new themes will have a tough time making it on the <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes/browse/popular/">popular themes page</a>.</p>\n<p>Originally, the popular themes page was determined by the number of downloads over the previous week, which led to some authors to try to <a href="http://wptavern.com/the-wordpress-theme-directory-no-longer-counts-automated-downloads">game the system</a>. Hulse says, &#8220;The actual comparison between active installs and the previous week&#8217;s downloads were very similar, except for a handful of themes that had a lot more downloads than installs.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Hulse plans to experiment with the algorithms to give newer themes a chance, &#8220;I’m also looking at ranking popular themes based on the age of the theme and installs, which will help promote some of the newer themes,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<p>Thanks to active install counts for themes, we can see which default WordPress theme is the most popular.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Twenty Fifteen 1+ Million</li>\n<li>Twenty Fourteen 800K+</li>\n<li>Twenty Twelve 500K+</li>\n<li>Twenty Eleven 500K+</li>\n<li>Twenty Ten 300K+</li>\n<li>Twenty Thirteen 300K+</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Download counts are a terrible way to determine a theme or plugin&#8217;s popularity which is why I support this change. It&#8217;s more accurate and helps to further level the playing field for authors.

The plugin is called <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/theme-designer">Theme Designer</a> and allows authors to manage themes in the WordPress backend. It also displays them on the frontend similar to <a href="https://wordpress.com/themes">WordPress.com</a> and <a href="https://wordpress.org/themes">WordPress.org&#8217;s</a> theme pages.</p>\n<p>Tadlock has moved beyond using WordPress pages to display and manage themes, &#8220;I’m not sure what everyone else is doing, but I’ve been building and tweaking a custom solution for a number of years. I’ve just never packaged it up and made it useful for others,&#8221; he said.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ThemeDesignerPlugin.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49114"><img class="size-full wp-image-49114" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ThemeDesignerPlugin.png?resize=1025%2C618" alt="Manage Themes in the WordPress Backend" /></a>Manage Themes in the WordPress Backend\n<p>Under the hood, it uses a custom post type, taxonomies, custom metadata, and a number of hooks. Theme Designer can pull data from the WordPress.org theme directory API and store it on your site. There’s also a built-in feature set for adding custom meta fields to the edit theme screen.</p>\n<p>In addition to managing themes, Tadlock plans to create add-ons and integrate Theme Designer with other plugins. He&#8217;s already created an add-on for Easy Digital Downloads and it&#8217;s possible he&#8217;ll create one for WooCommerce.</p>\n<h2>Tadlock&#8217;s First Commercial Plugin</h2>\n<p>During the beta testing period, Theme Designer will be free of charge. When the beta is complete, Tadlock will charge for access making it his first major commercial plugin. Theme Designer will come in two flavors, a supported and non-supported version.</p>\n<p>The supported version gives customers a <strong>developer level</strong> membership to Theme Hybrid which is currently $35 a year. The non-supported version contains the plugin only. Both versions will have free lifetime updates.</p>\n<p>To participate in the beta testing process, grab the free plugin <a href="https://github.com/justintadlock/theme-designer">from GitHub</a>. Pull requests and reporting issues are welcomed. It&#8217;s important to note that Theme Designer is <strong>only compatible</strong> with WordPress 4.4 and is a work in progress so it should not be used on a live site.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 22:26:13 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:36;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:90:"WPTavern: Stanko Metodiev’s First-time Experience Contributing Patches to WordPress Core";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=49104";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:97:"http://wptavern.com/stanko-metodievs-first-time-experience-contributing-patches-to-wordpress-core";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2041:"<p>Stanko Metodiev, project manager for <a href="http://devrix.com/">Devrix</a>, shares his experience <a href="http://metodiew.com/my-first-wordpress-patch/">contributing a patch</a> to WordPress core for the first time.

Blogging has always been mistaken for its containers, tools, the length of the posts or just a replacement for the rapid-fire publishing of old-fashioned news. In reality, blogging is essentially a philosophy built on the ethos of sharing.</p>\n<p class="p1">Today sharing on the internet is a major social behavior: We share photos, links, videos, thoughts, opinions, news. Except instead of sharing on a blog, we do the sharing in increasingly proprietary and corporate silos: Instagram, Facebook, YouTube, Twitter, Periscope and LinkedIn. You see, the blogging ethos is alive and well. However, the old blogging tools have to embrace change.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p class="p1">At the end of the day, it&#8217;s not about technology for technology&#8217;s sake, it&#8217;s about technology at the service of human voices. Embracing change to support the free, open web where everyone has a voice.</p>\n<p class="p1">Finally, it was a weird coincidence we didn&#8217;t even notice, but the Calypso announcement was <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2005/11/23/opening-it-up/">ten years to the day after we opened up WordPress.com</a>.</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 24 Nov 2015 19:42:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:38;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:86:"WPTavern: Automattic Unveils Open Source WordPress.com Desktop Application for the Mac";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=49077";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:92:"http://wptavern.com/automattic-unveils-open-source-wordpress-desktop-application-for-the-mac";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:5489:"<p>In the last two years, Automattic has made significant improvements to WordPress.com and Jetpack. From managing<a href="http://wptavern.com/you-can-now-search-for-and-install-plugins-from-within-jetpack-manage"> plugins, themes, and other updates</a> to <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2013/06/17/beautiful-makeover/">New Dash</a> and a revamped <a href="https://en.support.wordpress.com/new-post-screen/">post editor</a>. The individual changes represent iteration but when seen as a whole, show off an entirely new WordPress.com.</p>\n<p>Automattic has <a href="https://en.blog.wordpress.com/2015/11/23/the-new-wordpress-dot-com/">announced</a> that the improvements its made in the last two years are part of an internal project <a href="https://desktop.wordpress.com/">named Calypso</a>. The company also released a WordPress.com desktop application for the Mac and <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/calypso/">open sourced</a> the code on <a href="https://github.com/Automattic/wp-calypso">GitHub</a>.</p>\n<p>The application is written entirely in JavaScript using the <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> libraries. It&#8217;s also <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">100% reliant</a> on APIs, including the REST API.</p>\n<h2>My Experience with Calypso</h2>\n<p>Over the weekend, I tested the application on my Macbook Pro. I initially thought it was inconsistent as there were many instances where a button opened a browser and took me outside the app. However, Calypso has gone through a number of updates and most of the inconsistencies have disappeared.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso1.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49080"><img class="wp-image-49080 size-full" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso1.png?resize=1025%2C795" alt="Calypso1" /></a>Calypso\n<p>Most of what you&#8217;re able to accomplish in the WordPress backend you can do in the app including, editing posts, creating drafts, and moderating comments.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso2.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49081"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49081" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso2.png?resize=1025%2C799" alt="Calypso2" /></a>Although there is the occasional Beep&#8230;.Beep&#8230;.Boop, the application is fast. Some of the pages within the app feel like they load faster than their browser counterparts. Some things still require action from within a browser such as applying updates. This doesn&#8217;t make sense considering the Jetpack Manage module is enabled.</p>\n<p>When managing themes, I noticed at least two of the them don&#8217;t include the white bottom bar making the titles difficult to read. Also, the details link loads a browser window to the backend of the site I&#8217;m managing. It feels like an interruption instead of a seamless experience. There should be no reason to load a browser window except for previewing a post.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso3.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49082"><img class="wp-image-49082 size-full" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Calypso3.png?resize=1025%2C790" alt="Calypso3" /></a>Managing Themes in Calypso\n<p>If you&#8217;re familiar with or use the WordPress.com post editor, the editor in Calypso is pretty much the same.</p>\n<p>For years I&#8217;ve written posts with meta boxes on the right and getting used to them on the left will take a while. The editor has most of the features available in WordPress. For example, oEmbed support which many other third-party WordPress apps don&#8217;t have.</p>\n<p>When the application is in full-screen mode, it looks great and blocks out distractions. In the most recent update however, the Preview button acts like a Save button and doesn&#8217;t show a preview of the post. This is likely a bug and will be fixed in a later version.</p>\n<p><a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CalypsoPostEditingScreen.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49083"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-49083" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/CalypsoPostEditingScreen.png?resize=1025%2C790" alt="CalypsoPostEditingScreen" /></a>Calypso is a great example of what&#8217;s possible with the WordPress REST API. There are still a few instances when clicking a button takes you outside the app but those will be fixed in future updates.</p>\n<p>Overall, it&#8217;s convenient to have access to most of WordPress&#8217; features without interacting with a browser. For those who use a Mac, I can easily see Calypso being the preferred way to interact and manage WordPress sites.</p>\n<p>As Matt Mullenweg <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/dance-to-calypso/">mentions in his post</a>, there&#8217;s still a lot of work left to do, &#8220;This is a beginning, not an ending.

The code behind the app is also the foundation for a new version of the WordPress.com browser editor.</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a quick video walkthrough:</p>\n<p><span class="embed-youtube"></span></p>\n<p>The new WordPress.com app development occurred over the course of at least 18 months, according to the press release, with input from more than 140 Automatticians. <a href="http://apeatling.com/about-me/">Andy Peatling</a>, who has been at Automattic since 2008, was the project lead.</p>\n<h3>If you could rebuild the admin from scratch</h3>\n<p>Matt Mullenweg said that Automattic wanted to completely rethink the WordPress admin experience, without the burden of backward compatibility that WordPress core must hold sacred:</p>\n<blockquote><p><strong>What would we build if we were starting from scratch today, knowing all we’ve learned over the past 13 years of building WordPress?</strong> At the beginning of last year, we decided to start experimenting and see.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Calypso was an ambitious project. Not only does it bring the WordPress editing and publishing experience to a Mac app, but pretty much the entire WordPress.com admin experience is now available on the desktop, from stats to theme shopping.</p>\n<p>While the app is definitely geared toward the experience one would expect on a WordPress.com website, you can also manage <a href="http://jetpack.me/2015/11/23/jwordpress-com-app-for-mac/">Jetpack enabled</a> websites with it. The Jetpack Manage feature must be enabled for it to work, and I admit I struggled to get it to function with my own (personal) website. However, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;ll get any kinks worked out, and anyone looking for basic website management, but are on WordPress.org, may enjoy the experience.</p>\n<h3>Open sourcing WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>The most important part of the announcement is that Automattic is open sourcing Calypso and the many APIs that help drive it.</p>\n<blockquote><p>A lot of people thought we should keep this proprietary, but throughout my life I’ve learned that the more you give away, the more you get back. We still have a ton to figure out around plugins, extensibility, contributions, Windows and Linux releases, API speed, localization, and harmonizing the WordPress.com API and WP-API so it can work with core WordPress. Thousands more PHP developers will need to become fluent with Javascript to recreate their admin interfaces in this fashion. I’m also really excited to revisit and redesign many more screens now that we have this first version out the door.</p></blockquote>\n<p>I&#8217;m really glad they chose to open source it. I agree with Matt that both the app and the broader community will benefit from the decision; though I don&#8217;t doubt it may have been a tough sell to investors.</p>\n<p>I also agree with Ben Thompson (a former Automattician, by chance), <a href="https://stratechery.com/2015/tensorflow-and-monetizing-intellectual-property/">who once said</a> that proprietary software itself isn&#8217;t necessarily what makes a company successful, but rather, &#8220;companies that are built on software but differentiated by a difficult-to-replicate complement to said software.&#8221;</p>\n<p>In Automattic&#8217;s case, open sourcing the techniques to build the app isn&#8217;t giving away what is most valuable. What is most valuable to them is what they gain from the open source nature of the software, that will allow them to improve the experience for their vast WordPress.com user base.</p>\n<h3>Calypso is a good step forward for WordPress.com</h3>\n<p>I&#8217;ve worried for a while now that Automattic may be letting their audience slip, by falling behind the ease of use of other tools, like Medium. I think the new WordPress.com editor, and the corresponding WordPress.com app, are a great improvement to the writing experience, and I think that the investment they&#8217;ve made is a smart one.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;ll be digging more into the code and developer components of the new APIs and the Mac app soon. I didn&#8217;t have access to that data prior to launch.</p>\n<p>The new app is available for <a href="http://desktop.wordpress.com/">download from WordPress.com</a> now, or you can of course test drive the browser version directly on WordPress.com.

When I took on the <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/01/toni-automattic-ceo/">responsibility of CEO of Automattic January of last year</a>, we faced two huge problems: our growth was constrained by lack of capital, and the technological foundations of the past decade weren’t strong enough for the demands of next one.</p>\n<p>The first has a relatively straightforward answer. We found some fantastic partners, agreed on a fair price, <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/05/new-funding-for-automattic/">issued new equity in the company to raise $160M</a>, and started investing in areas we felt were high potential, like <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/05/woomattic/">this year’s WooCommerce acquisition</a>. This &#8220;war chest&#8221; gives us a huge array of options, especially given our fairly flat burn rate &#8212; we don&#8217;t need to raise money again to keep the company going, and any capital we raise in the future will be purely discretionary. (Since last May when the round happened we&#8217;ve only spent $3M of the investment on <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Operating_expense">opex</a>.)</p>\n<p>The second is much harder to address. The <a href="https://wordpress.org/">WordPress</a> codebase is actually incredible in many ways &#8212; the result of many thousands of people collaborating over 13 years &#8212; but some of WordPress’ greatest strengths were also holding it back.</p>\n<p>The WordPress codebase contains a sea of institutional knowledge and countless bug fixes. It handles hundreds of edge cases. Integrates constant security improvements. Is coded to scale. Development moves at a fast clip, with <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/category/releases/">six major releases over the past two years</a> and more <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/tag/4-4/">around the corner</a>. Its power and flexibility is undeniable: WordPress just passed a huge milestone, <a href="http://ma.tt/2015/11/seventy-five-to-go/">and now powers 25% of the web</a>. You can run it on a $5-a-month web host, or scale it up to serve billions of pageviews on one of the largest sites on the web, <a href="https://wordpress.com/">WordPress.com</a>.</p>\n<p>The interface, however, has been a struggle. Many of us attempted to give it a reboot with the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/core/2013/10/23/mp6-3-8-proposal/">MP6 project</a> and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/news/2013/12/parker/">version 3.8 release</a>, but what that release made clear to me is that an incremental approach wouldn&#8217;t give us the improvements we needed, and that two of the things that helped make WordPress the strong, stable, powerful tool it is &#8212; backward compatibility and working without JavaScript &#8212; were actually holding it back.</p>\n<p>The basic paradigms of wp-admin are largely the same as they were five years ago. Working within them had become limiting. The time seemed ripe for something new, something big… but if you&#8217;re going to break back compat, it needs to be for a really good reason. A 20x improvement, not a 2x. Most open source projects fade away rather than make evolutionary jumps.</p>\n<p>So we asked ourselves a big question. <strong>What would we build if we were starting from scratch today, knowing all we&#8217;ve learned over the past 13 years of building WordPress?</strong> At the beginning of last year, we decided to start experimenting and see.</p>\n<p>Today we&#8217;re announcing something brand new, a new approach to WordPress, and open sourcing the code behind it. The project, codenamed Calypso, is the culmination of more than 20 months of work by dozens of the most talented engineers and designers I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of working with (127 contributors with over 26,000 commits!).</p>\n<p><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-45613" src="http://i1.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2015/11/gm-2015-final.jpg?resize=604%2C431" alt="gm-2015-final" /></p>\n<p>Calypso is&#8230;</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Incredibly fast. It&#8217;ll charm you.</li>\n<li>Written purely in JavaScript, leveraging libraries like <a href="https://nodejs.org/en/">Node</a> and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>.</li>\n<li>100% API-powered. Those APIs <a href="https://developer.wordpress.com/docs/api/">are open</a>, and now available to every developer in the world.</li>\n<li>A great place to read, allowing you to follow sites across the web (even if they&#8217;re not using WordPress).</li>\n<li>Social, with stats, likes, and notifications baked in.</li>\n<li>Fully responsive. Make it small and put it in your sidebar, or go full-screen.</li>\n<li>Really fun to write in, especially the drag-and-drop image uploads.</li>\n<li>Fully multi-site for advanced users, so you can manage hundreds of WordPresses from one place.</li>\n<li>Able to manage plugins and themes on <a href="http://jetpack.me/">Jetpack</a> sites, including auto-upgrading them!</li>\n<li>100% open source, with all future development happening in the open.</li>\n<li>Available for anyone to adapt to make their own, including building custom interfaces, distributions, or working with web services besides WordPress.com.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>A lot of people thought we should keep this proprietary, but throughout my life I&#8217;ve learned that the more you give away, the more you get back. We still have a ton to figure out around plugins, extensibility, contributions, Windows and Linux releases, API speed, localization, and harmonizing the WordPress.com API and WP-API so it can work with core WordPress. Thousands more PHP developers will need to become fluent with JavaScript to recreate their admin interfaces in this fashion. I&#8217;m also really excited to revisit and redesign many more screens now that we have this first version out the door.</p>\n<p>This is a beginning, not an ending. (<a href="http://ma.tt/2010/11/one-point-oh/">1.0 is the loneliest</a>.) Better things are yet to come, as all of you dig in.

Like any disruption it is uncomfortable, and I&#8217;m sure will be controversial in some circles. What the team has accomplished in such a short time is amazing, and I’m incredibly proud of everyone who has contributed and will contribute in the future. This is the most exciting project I&#8217;ve been involved with in my career.</p>\n<p>With core WordPress on the server and Calypso as a client I think we have a good chance to bring another 25% of the web onto open source, making the web a more open place, and people&#8217;s lives <a href="http://ma.tt/2014/01/four-freedoms/">more free</a>.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re curious more about the before and after, what&#8217;s changed, here&#8217;s a chart:</p>\n<p><img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-45626" src="http://i1.wp.com/ma.tt/files/2015/11/Whats-New-WPcom@2x.png?resize=604%2C1300" alt="Whats-New-WPcom@2x" /></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Mon, 23 Nov 2015 17:01:05 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:4:"Matt";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:41;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:95:"WPTavern: Nearly Half of the WordPress Plugins in the Directory Are Not Updated After Two Years";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=49050";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:105:"http://wptavern.com/nearly-half-of-the-wordpress-plugins-in-the-directory-are-not-updated-after-two-years";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2813:"<p>Luca Fracassi, founder of <a href="https://addendio.com/">Addendio</a>, an alternative search engine for the WordPress plugin and theme directories published an <a href="https://addendio.com/2015-will-be-a-record-year-for-wordpress-plugins/">in-depth look</a> at the WordPress plugin directory. The post includes data that shows the number of plugins added to the directory per year, what year the plugins were last updated, and other metrics.</p>\n<p>My favorite data point is the number of plugins approved per year. Based on this data, it looks like it&#8217;s going to be another record year for the directory. The five active team members including, Mika Epstein, Pippin Williamson, and Samuel Wood have their work cut out for them.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NumberOfPluginsAddedPerYear.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49062"><img class="size-full wp-image-49062" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/NumberOfPluginsAddedPerYear.png?resize=939%2C684" alt="Number of Plugins Added Per Year" /></a>Number of Plugins Added Per Year\n<p>According to the data, about 22K plugins have been updated in the last 24 months representing a little more than half the directory. This means that approximately half of the plugins in the directory are displaying a notice that the plugin hasn&#8217;t been updated in two years.</p>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PluginUpdateTwoYearNotice.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49066"><img class="size-full wp-image-49066" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/PluginUpdateTwoYearNotice.png?resize=785%2C84" alt="Update Notice After Two Years of No Updates" /></a>Update Notice After Two Years of No Updates\n<p>Fracassi says that based on the data, &#8220;Two out of ten plugins are updated after three years. If you pick a free plugin that is released today, there’s a 80-90% chance that in three years time you won’t have any more updates.&#8221;</p>\n<p>There are a number of possibilities as to why a plugin doesn&#8217;t get updated for two years or more.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The developer burns out or moves on.</li>\n<li>The plugin doesn&#8217;t need an update.</li>\n<li>Lack of donations.</li>\n<li>Support is too much of a burden.</li>\n<li>No time.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>The data doesn&#8217;t spell doom and gloom for users but it clearly shows that many plugins within the directory don&#8217;t have a long shelf life. I encourage you to <a href="https://addendio.com/2015-will-be-a-record-year-for-wordpress-plugins/">read Fracassi&#8217;s post</a> and review the data he&#8217;s collected.

Some theme authors are having to <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?status=new&status=reopened&keywords=!~buddypress&col=id&col=summary&col=priority&col=status&col=owner&col=type&col=time&col=changetime&report=5&order=priority">wait two months</a> or more for their first review.</p>\n<p>Ashley Evans submitted <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318">her theme</a> in June and she&#8217;s yet to complete the review process. Throughout that time period, both Evans and the reviewer experienced delays in responding to each other. A few months into the review, the <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318#comment:21">reviewer disappeared</a> and Evans was <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/ticket/25318#comment:23">assigned a new reviewer</a> two days ago.</p>\n<p>Understandably, the experience has discouraged Evan&#8217;s from submitting anymore themes to the directory:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Back in August, I said, &#8216;Screw it&#8217; and released the theme as a free download on my blog. This process has basically made me vow to stick to adding plugins to the repo and stop adding any more themes.</p>\n<p>I&#8217;m not blaming the theme review team since I can only imagine how much stuff they have to wade through. It&#8217;s just sad that the process has discouraged me from ever doing it again.</p></blockquote>\n<p>On October 9th, Tammie Lister <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/10/09/forgotten-review-push-sometimes-themes-get-forgotten-in/">updated the Theme Review queues</a> and identified a number of themes that fell through the cracks. Most of those <a href="https://themes.trac.wordpress.org/query?id=26151,26016,26194,25318,26167,25685,25310,25818,25650,26135,26195,25000,23405,23342,24027,24087,24094,24101,24143,24178,24203,26164,26084,24277,25651,24597,24411,25269,25992,25217,24540,25980,25969,25814,25245,25241,25181,25154,25122,25076,25068,24274,24993,25046,24178,24087,24101,24143,24765&col=id&col=summary&col=owner&col=status&col=time&col=reporter&report=30&order=time">themes were approved</a> or are still in the review process.</p>\n<h2>The System is Broken</h2>\n<p>Members of the WordPress Theme Review team agree that the system is broken. In June, the team <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/06/05/suggested-roadmap/">published its suggested roadmap</a> to improve multiple facets of the review process. One of the items on the list to help cut down the review queue is the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/2015/10/07/automation-here-we-come/">auto-approval</a> of theme updates. However, the team is still hard at work trying to code and implement changes to improve the system.</p>\n<h2>Help Them Help You</h2>\n<a href="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/school.jpg" rel="attachment wp-att-27795"><img class="size-full wp-image-27795" src="http://i2.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/school.jpg?resize=1025%2C487" alt="photo credit: Rob Shenk via - cc" /></a>photo credit: <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/rcsj/2915797223/">Rob Shenk</a> via &#8211; <a href="http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/2.0/">cc</a>\n<p>One of the items high on the team&#8217;s to-do list is to put more effort towards education. In order to do that, Justin Tadlock says the team has to free up resources, &#8220;We need to free up our biggest resources, which are the team members themselves. However, we can&#8217;t free up those people when they&#8217;re spending 100% of their time doing reviews.&#8221;</p>\n<p>The most important thing theme authors can do to speed up the review process is to check that your theme meets the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/required/">Theme Review Requirements</a>. According to Tadlock, &#8220;The majority of themes submitted don&#8217;t follow the guidelines which considerably slows down the process. Themes will often have 20-30 issues or more. If we can get to a point to where the majority of submissions only have a few minor issues, we really wouldn&#8217;t have a queue.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Theme authors who test their themes against <a href="https://codex.wordpress.org/Theme_Unit_Test">Theme Unit Test Data</a> and the <a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/theme-check/">Theme Check Plugin</a> substantially improve the system for everyone. What the team needs most is help. Tadlock offers three ways contributors can get involved to improve the situation.</p>\n<ol>\n<li><a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/">Doing reviews</a>.</li>\n<li>Tackling Meta Trac tickets related to the theme directory.</li>\n<li>Writing tutorials.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>Tadlock isn&#8217;t sure how to get theme authors to raise the quality of their themes before the initial review, &#8220;That&#8217;s the sort of feedback I want to see from fellow theme authors. What do we need to do to help them get their themes ready before submission?&#8221;</p>\n<h2>How to Get Involved</h2>\n<p>The team is always in need of more theme reviewers. Reviewing themes is a great way to learn theme development and what not to do. If you&#8217;re interested in reviewing themes, read the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/get-involved/become-a-reviewer/">following document</a> from the Theme Review Handbook. It explains how to set up a testing environment with an example of a <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/themes/handbook/review/review-workflow/">testing workflow</a>.</p>\n<p>The Theme Review Team also has a project meeting every <a href="http://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/fixedtime.html?iso=20151110T1800"><abbr class="date" title="2015-11-10T18:00:00+00:00">Tuesday, November 10, 2015, 1:00 PM EST</abbr></a> in the <strong>#themereview</strong> channel on <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Slack</a>.</p>\n<h2>Exercise Patience</h2>\n<p>Exercising patience is a difficult thing to do if you&#8217;ve already waited eight weeks or more for the first review. However, fixing the system is going to take time. If you want to know about the status of your theme and it has an assigned reviewer, you should ask for a status update within the ticket. If your theme doesn&#8217;t have an assigned reviewer, you can ask about its status in the <a href="https://make.wordpress.org/chat/">Theme Review Team Slack</a> channel with a link to the theme.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 17:20:59 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:47;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:102:"WPTavern: Imperva’s Web Application Attack Report Shows Spam Is WordPress’ Largest Security Threat";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=48995";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:106:"http://wptavern.com/impervas-web-application-attack-report-shows-spam-is-wordpress-largest-security-threat";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:6738:"<p><a href="http://www.imperva.com">Imperva</a>, an international cyber security company founded in 2002, published its <a href="http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed6.pdf">2015 web application attack report</a>. The report includes a thorough analysis of attack data obtained through its WAF or Web Application Firewall.</p>\n<p>In the report, Imperva&#8217;s application defense center group analyzed 297,954 attacks and 22,850,023 alerts on 198 of the applications it protects behind its WAF. The data is from January 1st, 2015 &#8211; June 30th, 2015 and provides a solid overview of the number and types of attacks web applications are experiencing.</p>\n<p>The report covers a lot of ground but for the purpose of this site, I&#8217;m focusing on WordPress.</p>\n<h2>Analysis Methodology</h2>\n<p>Automated tools recorded the web applications’ traffic and malicious events were documented in log files. Imperva&#8217;s application defense center group analyzed the data using special-purpose software and its knowledge base.</p>\n<p>You can find more information that explains how the data was analyzed on page seven of the report.</p>\n<h2>WordPress Is the Most Attacked CMS Application</h2>\n<p>Out of the 198 applications protected, Imperva identified 55 that are CMS-based, 20 WordPress applications, 11 Drupal, and 24 that are based on 11 other CMS frameworks.</p>\n<a href="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackIncidentCMSAverage.png" rel="attachment wp-att-48998"><img class="size-full wp-image-48998" src="http://i1.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackIncidentCMSAverage.png?resize=875%2C470" alt="Average Number of Incidents per Applications CMS Slice" /></a>Average Number of Incidents per Applications CMS Slice\n<p>According to the report, CMS applications suffered an average of three times more attacks than non-CMS applications. WordPress applications suffered from 3,497 attacks in the reported period which is 250% more than non-CMS Applications. Note from the above image that spam attacks against WordPress outnumber all other types of attacks.</p>\n<p>Imperva says the attraction to CMS applications, especially WordPress is not new.</p>\n<blockquote><p>CMS frameworks have an open nature,  with open developer communities that generate a never-ending sequence of plug-ins and add-ons, with varying levels of security. This situation has led to corresponding never-ending flow of CMS vulnerabilities, with WordPress as the leading CMS taking the lead also in the amount of published attacks.</p>\n<p>Furthermore, the fact that WordPress and other CMS applications resemble each other facilitates automated scanning attacks that work effectively on all applications of this type with only minimal adjustments.</p></blockquote>\n<p>Varying levels of security in plugins have led to many vulnerabilities making WordPress the leader in the amount of published attacks.</p>\n<h2>Proportions of Attacks</h2>\n<p>Taking spam attacks out of the equation, the most popular attack type against WordPress applications is (RCE) Remote Command Execution with (RFI) Remote File Inclusion taking second place.</p>\n<a href="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackTypeProportions.png" rel="attachment wp-att-49000"><img class="size-full wp-image-49000" src="http://i0.wp.com/wptavern.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/ImpervaAttackTypeProportions.png?resize=719%2C400" alt="Proportion of Attack Types" /></a>Proportion of Attack Types\n<ul>\n<li>Remote File Inclusion (RFI) is an attack that allows an attacker to include a remote file, usually through a script, on the web server. This attack can lead to data theft or manipulation, malicious code execution on the web server, or malicious code execution on the application client side such as JavaScript execution, which can lead to other attacks. This vulnerability occurs due to the use of user-supplied input without proper validation.</li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li>Remote Command Execution (RCE) is an attack that allows the attacker to execute operating system commands in a system shell. The attack exploits applications that suffer from insufficient input validation in conjunction with passing this input to a system shell. The attacker’s payload is executed with the same privileges of the vulnerable application and can lead to full compromise of the server.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Even though the other monitored CMS applications are written in PHP, RFI attacks on WordPress are significantly higher than all other applications. Imperva offers one possible explanation:</p>\n<blockquote><p>Attackers don’t target a specific application, but start with scanning the Internet for vulnerable applications. A Low Hanging Fruit approach that is simple and effective for the detection of potential RFI targets, would be to run a WordPress test and mount an RFI attack in case of success.</p></blockquote>\n<p>The <a href="http://www.imperva.com/docs/HII_Web_Application_Attack_Report_Ed6.pdf">report</a> goes on to show geographic attack trends, PHP vs non-PHP attack incidents, traffic volume, case studies, and more.</p>\n<h2>No Need to Panic</h2>\n<p>Even though it&#8217;s only six months of data, the results don&#8217;t surprise me. WordPress is <a href="http://wptavern.com/a-quarter-of-the-top-10-million-sites-ranked-by-alexa-use-wordpress">used on a quarter of the top 10 million websites</a> ranked by Alexa so of course its going to be the most attacked CMS.</p>\n<p>The data in the report reinforces my belief that every public site online is likely being scanned or attacked multiple times a day. Unless you&#8217;re using a service or plugin that logs these types of attacks, its hard to know how popular of a target a site is.</p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re aware of a plugin or service that provides a user-friendly interface that shows and explains the attacks it&#8217;s protecting against a site, please send me a link in the comments.</p>\n<h2>Basic Security Principles</h2>\n<p>It&#8217;s imperative that you use a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication">strong password</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Two-factor_authentication">two-factor authentication</a>. Consider using a service like <a href="https://getclef.com/">Clef</a> that allows you to login to WordPress without a password. I also highly encourage you to read the <a href="http://wptavern.com/wordpress-publishes-security-white-paper">WordPress security whitepaper</a> to learn how WordPress protects itself against common attacks mentioned in Imperva&#8217;s report and how to responsibly disclose a WordPress security vulnerability.</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Tue, 17 Nov 2015 02:11:51 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}i:48;a:6:{s:4:"data";s:13:"\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n	\n";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";s:5:"child";a:2:{s:0:"";a:5:{s:5:"title";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:83:"WPTavern: WordPress Freelancer Adam Soucie on the Dangers of Accepting Credit Cards";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"guid";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:28:"http://wptavern.com/?p=48990";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:4:"link";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:93:"http://wptavern.com/wordpress-freelancer-adam-soucie-on-the-dangers-of-accepting-credit-cards";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:11:"description";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:2202:"<p>If you&#8217;re running or opening a new WordPress business, you should read <a href="http://adamsoucie.com/chargebacks-the-dangers-of-accepting-credit-cards/">Adam Soucie&#8217;s warning</a> on the dangers of accepting credit cards. Soucie, a WordPress Developer based in Orlando, Florida describes what happened after working with a client that claimed to be hearing disabled.</p>\n<p>Soucie went through the usual process of sending over a contract, bringing in a designer, discussing scope, and sending over an invoice. The client then claimed to be in the hospital and requested help to pay for one of the contractors involved in the project because he didn&#8217;t accept credit cards. According to Soucie, this should have been the red flag:</p>\n<blockquote><p>But I ignored it because I’ve also been a trusting person who is sympathetic to people with disabilities.  Plus I figured I had proof of everything, so I’d be protected.  I was so wrong.</p>\n<p>To make a long story short, the &#8216;client&#8217; was paying with stolen credit cards and the other contractor was in on the scam.  I discovered the scam when they started getting pushy about the contractor receiving his payments.  When leaving to make the final payment, I got a call from the person whose credit card info was stolen.  I reached out to my &#8216;client&#8217; and she had disappeared.</p></blockquote>\n<p>As the merchant, Soucie was liable for the transaction. After not receiving help from the FBI Cyber Crimes division and the credit card companies, QuickBooks, Soucie&#8217;s payment processor, went after him for the total amount of $10,000. He was able to get the amount slightly reduced after working with QuickBooks.

Haskins was initially going to list the company on Flippa but after receiving advice from <a href="https://syedbalkhi.com/">Syed Balkhi</a>, used <a href="http://feinternational.com/">FE International</a> to facilitate the sale. FE International is composed of website brokers that do the heavy lifting to help businesses find buyers.</p>\n<p>An anonymous company based on the US East Coast without ties to the WordPress community is the new owner of Aesop Interactive LLC. Although terms of the deal are not public, Haskins confirms that he received close to his asking price of $100K.</p>\n<p>When Haskins put the company up for sale, he specified two conditions the new owner must follow.</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Aesop Story Engine MUST absolutely be maintained and kept free.</li>\n<li>Editus must continue forward with development, in some way shape or form.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>It&#8217;s unclear what the new owner&#8217;s plans are for Aesop Story Engine, Editus, and Story.AM.</p>\n<h2>Advice for Selling Your Company</h2>\n<p>The WordPress ecosystem is filled with thousands of companies from individuals to 50+ person agencies. Haskins offers the following advice for those thinking about selling their business, &#8220;Make sure that the books are buttoned up tight, because every check, every payment, every expense will be scrutinized and will ultimately determine what the appraisal price will be. Run a lean ship as the less overhead you have, the better.&#8221;</p>\n<p>During the appraisal process, Haskins had to account for and explain every check number written during the last few months. Although it was a lot of work on his end, he highly recommends using FE International as they manage the negotiating, contract writing, and appraisal processes.</p>\n<h2>What’s Next for Haskins?</h2>\n<p>Haskins isn&#8217;t giving up WordPress development as he continues to work with the software on a daily basis managing <a href="https://cgcookie.com/">CGCookie</a>. When I asked what&#8217;s next in his WordPress journey, he replied, &#8220;Overall, there will be another project. It&#8217;s just that this chapter of the story is finished. I want to eventually write and publish an eBook on my experiences of starting, running, and selling a business.&#8221;</p>\n<p>Who do you think the buyer is and what do you think will happen to Aesop Story Engine, Editus, and Story.AM?</p>\n<div id="epoch-width-sniffer"></div>";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}s:7:"pubDate";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:31:"Fri, 13 Nov 2015 22:31:07 +0000";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}s:32:"http://purl.org/dc/elements/1.1/";a:1:{s:7:"creator";a:1:{i:0;a:5:{s:4:"data";s:13:"Jeff Chandler";s:7:"attribs";a:0:{}s:8:"xml_base";s:0:"";s:17:"xml_base_explicit";b:0;s:8:"xml_lang";s:0:"";}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}}s:4:"type";i:128;s:7:"headers";a:10:{s:6:"server";s:5:"nginx";s:4:"date";s:29:"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 06:24:21 GMT";s:12:"content-type";s:8:"text/xml";s:14:"content-length";s:6:"243406";s:10:"connection";s:5:"close";s:4:"vary";s:15:"Accept-Encoding";s:13:"last-modified";s:29:"Fri, 11 Dec 2015 06:15:15 GMT";s:15:"x-frame-options";s:10:"SAMEORIGIN";s:4:"x-nc";s:11:"HIT lax 250";s:13:"accept-ranges";s:5:"bytes";}s:5:"build";s:14:"20151211061349";}', 'no');
